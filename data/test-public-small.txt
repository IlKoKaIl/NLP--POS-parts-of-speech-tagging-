Salem
(
special
)
--
For
a
second
month
in
a
row
,
Multnomah
County
may
be
short
of
general
assistance
money
in
its
budget
to
handle
an
unusually
high
summer
month's
need
,
the
state
public
welfare
commission
was
told
Friday
.
It
is
the
only
county
in
the
state
so
far
this
month
reporting
a
possible
shortage
in
GA
category
,
for
which
emergency
allotment
can
be
given
by
the
state
if
necessary
.
William
Smythe
,
director
of
field
service
,
told
the
commissioners
that
Multnomah
,
as
of
Aug.
22
,
had
spent
$58,918
out
of
its
budgeted
$66,000
in
the
category
,
leaving
only
$7,082
for
the
rest
of
the
month
.
At
the
rate
of
need
indicated
in
the
early
weeks
of
the
month
,
this
could
mean
a
shortage
of
as
high
as
$17,000
.
But
it
probably
will
be
less
because
of
a
usual
slackening
during
the
last
weeks
of
each
month
,
Smythe
said
.
No
request
for
emergency
allotment
had
yet
been
received
,
however
.
Board
oks
pact
The
commission
,
meeting
for
the
first
time
with
both
of
its
newly-appointed
commissioners
,
Roy
Webster
,
of
Hood
River
,
and
Dr.
Ennis
Keizer
,
of
North
Bend
,
approved
a
year's
contract
for
a
consultant
in
the
data
processing
department
who
has
been
the
center
of
considerable
controversy
in
the
past
.
The
contract
with
Ray
Field
,
who
has
been
converting
the
agencies
electronic
data
processing
program
to
magnetic
tape
,
would
renew
his
present
salary
of
$8
an
hour
up
to
a
maximum
of
200
hours
a
month
.
Field
does
the
planning
for
the
machine
operations
and
fiscal
processes
and
the
adapting
of
the
data
processing
system
to
new
programs
as
they
are
made
necessary
by
legislative
and
policy
changes
.
Acting
Administrator
Andrew
F.
Juras
said
that
because
of
Field's
unique
position
and
knowledge
in
the
program
,
the
agency
now
would
be
seriously
handicapped
if
he
was
not
continued
for
a
period
.
