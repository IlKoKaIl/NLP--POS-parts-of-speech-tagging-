But
he
emphasized
that
the
agency
must
train
people
within
its
own
employ
to
fulfill
what
Field
handles
,
and
he
said
he
personally
``
regrets
very
much
that
the
agency
has
not
done
this
in
the
past
''
.
He
pointed
out
to
the
commissioners
that
the
agency
was
literally
dependent
now
on
the
machine
processing
,
``
and
the
whole
wheels
of
the
agency
would
stop
if
it
broke
down
or
the
three
or
four
persons
directing
it
were
to
leave
''
.
Salary
termed
modest
Juras
said
he
insisted
Field
be
continued
on
a
consultant
basis
only
and
be
answerable
directly
to
the
administrator
of
the
agency
and
not
to
other
agencies
of
the
government
.
He
also
said
that
the
salary
,
in
terms
of
going
rates
in
the
field
,
was
``
modest
''
in
terms
of
the
man's
responsibility
.
The
conversion
to
magnetic
tape
is
not
yet
completed
,
he
said
,
and
added
Field's
long
service
in
state
government
and
welfare
employ
gave
him
familiarity
with
the
welfare
program
.
``
Do
you
feel
you
can
stand
up
to
the
next
legislative
session
and
defend
this
contract
''

Asked
Mrs.
Grace
O.
Peck
,
representative
from
Multnomah
County
,
of
the
commission
chairman
,
Joseph
E.
Harvey
Jr.
.
``
My
feeling
at
the
moment
''
,
he
said
,
``
is
that
we
have
no
alternative
,
irrespective
of
some
of
the
arguments
about
him
.
The
continued
operation
of
this
program
depends
on
having
his
service
''
.
Harvey
criticized
Mrs.
Peck
,
later
joined
by
the
commission's
vice-chairman
,
Mrs.
Lee
Patterson
,
took
Harvey
to
task
for
comments
he
had
made
to
the
North
Portland
Rotary
Club
Tuesday
.
A
publicity
release
from
Oregon
Physicians
Service
,
of
which
Harvey
is
president
,
quoted
him
as
saying
the
welfare
office
move
to
Salem
,
instead
of
``
crippling
''
the
agency
,
had
provided
an
avenue
to
correct
administrative
weaknesses
,
with
the
key
being
improved
communications
between
F
&
A
and
the
commission
staff
.
``
I
rather
resent
''
,
she
said
,
``
you
speaking
to
those
groups
in
Portland
as
though
just
the
move
accomplished
this
.
I
think
you
fell
short
of
the
real
truth
in
the
matter
:
That
the
move
is
working
out
through
the
fine
cooperation
of
the
staff
and
all
the
people
.
The
staff
deserves
a
lot
of
credit
working
down
here
under
real
obstacles
''
.
Harvey
said
his
objective
was
to
create
a
better
public
image
for
welfare

Employes
of
Pawtucket's
garbage

collection
contractor
picketed
the
firm's
incinerator
site
yesterday
in
the
second
day
of
a
strike
for
improved

and
working
conditions
.
Thomas
Rotelli
,
head
of
Rhode

Incinerator
Service
,
Inc.
,
said
four
of
the
company's
eight
trucks
were
making
collections
with
both
newly
hired
and
regular
workers
.
Sydney
Larson
,
a
staff
representative
for
the
United
Steel
Workers
,
which
the
firm's
25
workers
joined
before
striking
,
said
the
state
Labor
Relations
Board
has
been
asked
to
set
up
an
election
to
pick
a

.
A
62-year-old
Smithfield
man
,
Lester
E.
Stone
of
19
Beverly
Circle
,
was
in
satisfactory
condition
last
night
at
Our
Lady
of
Fatima
Hospital
,
North
Providence
,
with
injuries
suffered
when
a
car
he
was
driving
struck
a
utility
pole
on
Woonasquatucket
Avenue
in
North
Providence
near
Stevens
Street
.
Mr.
Stone
suffered
fractured
ribs
and
chest
cuts
,
hospital
authorities
said
.
He
was
taken
to
the
hospital
by
the
North
Providence
ambulance
.
Before
hitting
the
pole
,
Mr.
Stone's
car
brushed
against
a
car
driven
by
Alva
W.
Vernava
,
21
,
of
23
Maple
Ave.
,
North
Providence
,
tearing
away
the
rear
bumper
and
denting
the
left
rear
fender
of
the
Vernava
car
,
police
said
.
Mr.
Vernava
was
uninjured
.
The
impact
with
the
utility
pole
caused
a
brief
power
failure
in
the
immediate
area
of
the
accident
.
One
house
was
without
power
for
about
half
an
hour
,
a
Narragansett
Electric
Co.
spokesman
said
.
The
power
was
off
for
about
five
minutes
in
houses
along
Smith
Street
as
far
away
as
Fruit
Hill
Avenue
shortly
before
5
p.m.
when
the
accident
occurred
.
The
fight
over
the
Warwick
School
Committee's
appointment
of
a
coordinator
of
audio-visual
education
may
go
to
the
state
Supreme
Court
,
it
appeared
last
night
.
Two
members
of
the
Democratic-endorsed
majority
on
the
school
board
said
they
probably
would
vote
to
appeal
a
ruling
by
the
state
Board
of
Education
,
which
said
yesterday
that
the
school
committee
acted
improperly
in
its
appointment
of
the
coordinator
,
Francis
P.
Nolan
3rd
,
the
Democratic-endorsed
committee
chairman
,
could
not
be
reached
for
comment
.
In
its
ruling
,
the
state
Board
of
Education
upheld
Dr.
Michael
F.
Walsh
,
state
commissioner
of
education
,
who
had
ruled
previously
that
the
Warwick
board
erred
when
it
named
Maurice
F.
Tougas
as
coordinator
of
audio-visual
education
without
first
finding
that
the
school
superintendent's
candidate
was
not
suitable
.
Supt.
Clarence
S.
Taylor
had
recommended
Roger
I.
Vermeersch
for
the
post

was
made
by
Judge
Fred
B.
Perkins
who
heard
their
petition
without
a
jury
by
agreement
of
the
parties

The
award
,
without

,
compared
with
a
valuation
of
$57,500
placed
on
the
property
by
the

The
FBI
yesterday
arrested
on
a
perjury
charge
one
of
the
members
of
the
jury
that
failed
to
reach
a
verdict
in
the
``
Freedom
Rider
''
bus
burning
trial
four
weeks
ago
.
U.S.
Attorney
Macon
Weaver
said
the
federal
complaint
,
charged
that
the
juror
gave
false
information
when
asked
about
Ku
Klux
Klan
membership
during
selection
of
jury
.
He
identified
the
man
as
Lewis
Martin
Parker
,
59
,
a
farmer
of
Hartselle
,
Ala.
.
Eight
men
were
tried
together
in
U.S.
District
Court
in
Anniston
,
Ala.
,
on
charges
of
interfering
with
interstate
transportation
and
conspiracy
growing
out
of
a
white
mob's
attack
on
a
Greyhound
bus
carrying
the
first
of
the
Freedom
Riders
.
The
bus
was
burned
outside
Anniston
.
One
of
the
eight
defendants
was
freed
on
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
.
A
mistrial
was
declared
in
the
case
against
the
other
seven
when
the
jury
was
unable
to
agree
on
a
verdict
.
The
arrest
of
Mr.
Parker
marks
the
third
charge
of
wrongdoing
involving
the
jury
that
heard
the
case
.
The
first
incident
occurred
before
the
trial
got
under
way
when
Judge
H.
Hobart
Grooms
told
the
jury
panel
he
had
heard
reports
of
jury-tampering
efforts
.
He
asked
members
of
the
panel
to
tell
him
if
anyone
outside
the
court
had
spoken
to
them
about
the
case
.
Two
members
of
the
panel
later
told
in
court
about
receiving
telephone
calls
at
their
homes
from
anonymous
persons
expressing
interest
in
the
trial
.
Neither
was
seated
on
the
jury
.
Then
,
when
the
case
went
to
the
jury
,
the
judge
excused
one
of
the
jurors
,
saying
the
juror
had
told
him
he
had
been
accosted
by
masked
men
at
his
motel
the
night
before
the
trial
opened
.
The
juror
said
the
masked
men
had
advised
him
to
be
lenient
.
The
judge
replaced
the
juror
with
an
alternate
.
No
formal
charges
have
been
filed
as
a
result
of
either
of
the
two
reported
incidents
.
At
the
opening
of
the
trial
,
the
jury
panel
was
questioned
as
a
group
by
Mr.
Weaver
about
Ku
Klux
Klan
connections
.
One
member
of
the
panel
--
not
Mr.
Parker
--
indicated
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
KKK
at
one
time
.
He
was
not
seated
on
the
jury
.
The
perjury
charge
against
Mr.
Parker
carries
a
maximum
penalty
of
$2,000
fine
and
five
years
imprisonment
on
conviction
.

Vast
spraying
programs
conducted
by
``
technicians
with
narrow
training
and
little
wisdom
''
are
endangering
crops
and
wildlife
,
Carl
W.
Buchheister
,
president
of
the
National
Audubon
Society
,
said
today
.
``
It
is
like
handing
a
loaded
automatic
to
an
8-year-old
and
telling
him
to
run
out
and
play
''
,
he
commented
.
Buchheister
told
delegates
to
the
West
Coast
Audubon
Convention
that
aerial
spraying
in
Louisiana
failed
to
destroy
its
target
,
the
fire
ant
.
``
But
it
did
destroy
the
natural
controls
of
a
borer
and
released
a
new
plague
that
wrecked
a
sugar
cane
crop
''
,
he
said
.
The
conservation
leader
said
other
mistakes
in
spraying
had
caused
serious
damage
in
Ohio
and
Wyoming
.
There
have
even
been
serious
errors
in
the
U.
S.
Forest
Service
,
whose
officials
pride
themselves
in
their
scientific
training
,
he
added
.
``
The
news
of
their
experiments
reaches
the
farmers
who
,
forgetting
that
birds
are
the
most
efficient
natural
enemies
of
insects
and
rodents
,
are
encouraged
to
try
to
get
rid
of
all
birds
that
occasionally
peck
their
grapes
or
their
blueberries
''
,
Buchheister
told
the
delegates
.
In
addition
to
urging
greater
restrictions
on
aerial
spraying
,
Buchheister
called
for
support
of
the
Wilderness
bill
,
creation
of
national
seashore
parks
,
including
Point
Reyes
;
;
preservation
of
the
wetlands

Seventeen
years
ago
today
,
German
scientist
Willy
Fiedler
climbed
into
a
makeshift
cockpit
installed
in
a
V-1
rocket-bomb
that
was
attached
to
the
underbelly
of
a
Heinkel
bomber
.
The
World
War
2
,
German
bomber
rolled
down
a
runway
and
took
off
.
The
only
way
Fiedler
could
get
back
to
earth
alive
was
to
fly
the
pulse
jet
missile
and
land
it
on
the
airstrip
.
This
had
never
been
done
before
.
Now
a
quiet-spoken
,
middle-aged
man
,
Fiedler
is
an
aeronautical
engineer
for
Lockheed's
Missiles
and
Space
Division
at
Sunnyvale
,
where
he
played
a
key
role
in
the
development
of
the
Navy's
Polaris
missile
.
He
sat
in
his
office
yesterday
and
recalled
that
historic
flight
in
1944
.
``
The
first
two
pilots
had
crashed
''
,
he
said
.
``
I
had
developed
the
machines
and
therefore
knew
them
.
It
was
time
to
go
up
myself
''
.
Fiedler
was
then
technical
director
of
Hitler's
super-secret
``
Reichenberg
project
''
,
which
remained
unknown
to
the
Allies
until
after
the
war
.
About
200
of
the
special
V-1
rocket-bombs
were
to
be
made
ready
for
manned
flight
with
an
explosive
warhead
.
The
target
was
Allied
shipping
--
a
desperate
effort
to
stave
off
the
Allied
invasion
of
Europe
.
The
success
of
the
project
depended
upon
Fiedler's
flight
.
Squeezed
into
the
few
cubic
feet
normally
filled
by
the
rocket's
automatic
guidance
mechanism
,
the
scientist
waited
while
the
bomber
gained
altitude
.
At
12,000
feet
,
Fiedler
signaled
``
release
''
,
and
started
the
roaring
pulse-jet
engine
--
then
streaked
away
from
beneath
the
Heinkel
.
To
the
German
pilot
in
the
bomber
the
rocket
became
a
faint
black
speck
,
hurtling
through
the
sky
at
the
then
incredible
speed
of
420
m.p.h.
.
It
was
probably
man's
first
successful
flight
in
a
missile
.
``
She
flew
beautifully
''
,
said
Fiedler
.
``
There
was
only
one
power
control
--
a
valve
to
adjust
the
fuel
flow
.
I
had
exactly
20
minutes
to
get
down
to
the
test
strip
''
.
Using
a
steering
system
that
controlled
the
modified
rocket's
tail
surfaces
and
wings
equipped
with
ailerons
,
Fiedler
was
to
land
the
missile
on
a
skid
especially
bolted
under
the
fuselage
.
He
managed
to
maneuver
the
missile
to
a
landing
speed
of
200
m.p.h.
--
fast
even
for
a
modern
jet
plane
touchdown
--
and
banked
into
the
airfield
.
Moments
later
the
V-1
skimmed
across
the
landing
strip
,
edging
closer
and
closer
to
a
touchdown
--
then
in
a
streamer
of
dust
it
landed
.
Fiedler
went
on
to
make
several
other
test
flights
before
German
pilots
took
over
the
Reichenberg
missiles
.
The
missiles
were
to
be
armed
with
an
underwater
bomb
.
Pilots
would
steer
them
in
a
suicide
dive
into
the
water
,
striking
below
the
waterline
of
individual
ships
.
A
crack
corps
of
50
pilots
was
formed
from
the
ranks
of
volunteers
,
but
the
project
was
halted
before
the
end
of
the
war
,
and
the
missiles
later
fell
into
Allied
hands
.
Now
a
family
man
with
three
children
,
Fiedler
lives
in
a
quiet
residential

A

called
10
witnesses
yesterday
in
an
investigation
of
the
affairs
of
Ben
Stein
,
47
,
who
collected
big
fees
as
a
``
labor
consultant
''
and
operator
of
a
janitors'
service
.
Before
he
testified
for
20
minutes
,
Stein
,
who
lives
at
3300
Lake
Shore
Dr.
,
admitted
to
reporters
that
he
had
a
wide
acquaintance
with
crime
syndicate
hoodlums
.
Glimco
a
buddy
Among
his
gangland
buddies
,
he
said
,
were
Joseph
(

Another
hoodlum
,
Louis
Arger
,
drew
$39,000
from
Stein's
janitor
firm
,
the
National
Maintenance
company
,
in
three
years
ending
in
1959
,
Stein
disclosed
in
an
interview
.
``
I
put
Arger
on
the
payroll
because
he
promised
to
get
my
firm
the
stevedore
account
at
Navy
pier
''
,
Stein
said
.
``
But
Arger
never
was
able
to
produce
it
,
so
I
cut
him
off
my
payroll
''
.
Connection
is
sought
Other
witnesses
,
after
appearances
before
the
jury
,
which
reportedly
is
probing
into
possible
income
tax
violations
,
disclosed
that
government
prosecutors
were
attempting
to
connect
Stein
and
his
company
with
a
number
of
gangsters
,
including
Glimco
and
Alex
.
The
federal
lawyers
,
according
to
their
witnesses
,
also
were
tracing
Stein's
fees
as
a
labor
consultant
.
Under
scrutiny
,
two
of
the
witnesses
said
,
were
payments
and
loans
to
Stein's
National
Maintenance
company
at
543
Madison
St.
.
The
company
supplies
janitors
and
workmen
for
McCormick
Place
and
factories
,
liquor
firms
,
and
other
businesses
.
Lee
a
witness
Among
the
witnesses
were
Ed
J.
Lee
,
director
of
McCormick

;
;
Jerome
Leavitt
,
a
partner
in
the
Union
Liquor
company
,

of
a
Glimco
dominated
deodorant
firm
,
the
Best
Sanitation

,
1215
Blue

.
Lee
said
he
had
told
the
jury
that
he
made
an
agreement
in
April
with
Stein
to
supply
and
supervise
janitors
in
McCormick
Place
.
Stein's
fee
,
Lee
said
,
was
10
per
cent
of
the
janitors'
pay
.
Stein
estimated
this
amount
at
``
about
$1,500
or
$1,600
a
month
''
.
A
$12,500
payment
Leavitt
,
as
he
entered
the
jury
room
,
said
he
was
prepared
to
answer
questions
about
the
$12,500
his
liquor
firm
paid
to
Stein
for
``
labor
consultant
work
''
with
five
unions
which
organized
Leavitt's
workers
.
Leavitt
identified
the
unions
as
a
warehouseman's
local
,
the
teamsters
union
,
a
salesman's
union
,
the
janitors'
union
,
and
a
bottling
workers'
union
.
Government
attorneys
,
Leavitt
said
,
have
questioned
him
closely
about
``
five
or
six
loans
''
totaling
about
$40,000
which
the
liquor
company
made
to
Stein
in
the
last
year
.
All
of
the
loans
,
in
amounts
up
to
$5,000
each
,
have
been
repaid
by
Stein
,
according
to
Leavitt
.
Stein
said
he
needed
the
money
,
Leavitt
said
,
to
``
meet
the
payroll
''
at
National
Maintenance
company

bureau
has
estimated
that
radioactive
fallout
from
the
test
might
arrive
here
next

A
board
of
health
spokesman
said
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
an
increase
in
the
level
here
will
occur
as
a

of
the
detonation

Wilmette
,
was
arrested
yesterday
on
a
suppressed
federal
warrant
charging
him
with
embezzling
an
undetermined
amount
of
money
from
the
First
Federal
Savings
and
Loan
association
,
1
S.
Dearborn
St.
,
where
he
formerly
was
employed
as
an
attorney
.
Federal
prosecutors
estimated
that
the
amount
may
total
$20,000
,
altho
a
spokesman
for
the
association
estimated
its
loss
at
approximately
$10,000
.
Lien
payments
involved
Huff's
attorney
,
Antone
F.
Gregorio
,
quoted
his
client
as
saying
that
part
of
the
embezzlement
represented
money
paid
to
Huff
,
as
attorney
for
the
loan
association
,
in
satisfaction
of
mechanic's
liens
on
property
on
which
the
association
held
mortgages
.
Huff
told
Gregorio
that
he
took
the
money
to
pay
``
the
ordinary
bills
and
expenses
of
suburban
living
''
.
Huff
,
who
received
a
salary
of
$109
a
week
from
the
loan
association
from
October
of
1955
until
September
of
this
year
,
said
that
his
private
practice
was
not
lucrative
.
Huff
lives
with
his
wife
,
Sue
,
and
their
four
children
,
6
to
10
years

,
in
a
$25,000
home
with
a
$17,000
mortgage
.
Charge
lists
3
checks
The
complaint
on
which
the
warrant
was
issued
was
filed
by
Leo
Blaber
,
an
attorney
for
the
association
.
The
shortage
was
discovered
after
Huff
failed
to
report
for
work
on
Sept.
18
.
On
that
date
,
according
to
Gregorio
,
Huff
left
his
home
and
took
a
room
in
the
New
Lawrence
hotel
at
1020
Lawrence
Av.
.
There
,
Gregorio
said
,
Huff
wrote
a
complete
statement
of
his
offense
.
Later
,
Huff
cashed
three
checks
for
$100
each
at
the
Sherman
House
,
using
a
credit
card
.
All
bounced
.
When
Huff
attempted
to
cash
another

(
UPI
)
--
Greece
and
West
Germany
have
ratified
an
agreement

which
Germany
will
pay
$28,700,000
to
Greek
victims
of

,
it
was
announced

Probably
the
hottest
thing
that
has
hit
the
Dallas
investment
community
in
years
was
the
Morton
Foods
stock
issue
,
which
was
sold
to
the
public
during
the
past
week
.
For
many
reasons
,
the
demand
to
buy
shares
in
the
Dallas-headquartered
company
was
tremendous
.
It
was
not
a
case
of
the
investment
bankers
having
to
sell
the
stock
;
;
it
was
more
one
of
allotting
a
few
shares
to
a
number
of
customers
and
explaining
to
others
why
they
had
no
more
to
sell
.
Investors
who
wanted
100
shares
in
many
cases
ended
up
with
25
,
and
customers
who
had
put
in
a
bid
to
buy
400
shares
found
themselves
with
100
and
counted
themselves
lucky
to
get
that
many
.
In
fact
,
very
few
customers
,
anywhere
in
the
nation
,
were
able
to
get
more
than
100
shares
.
Some
Dallas
investment
firms
got
only
100
shares
,
for
all
of
their
customers
.
A
measure
of
how
hot
the
stock
was
,
can
be
found
in
what
happened
to
it
on
the
market
as
soon
as
trading
began
.
The
stock
was
sold
in
the
underwriting
at
a
price
of
$12.50
a
share
.
The
first
over-the-counter
trade
Wednesday
afternoon
at
Eppler
,
Guerin
&
Turner
,
the
managing
underwriter
,
was
at
$17
a
share
.
And
from
that
the
stock
moved
right
on
up
until
it
was
trading
Thursday
morning
at
around
$22
a
share
.
But
the
Morton
Foods
issue
was
hot
long
before
it
was
on
the
market
.
Indeed
,
from
the
moment
the
reports
of
the
coming
issue
first
started
circulating
in
Dallas
last
January
,
the
inquiries
and
demand
for
the
stock
started
building
up
.
Letters
by
the
reams
came
in
from
investment
firms
all
over
the
nation
,
all
of
them
wanting
to
get
a
part
of
the
shares
that
would
be
sold
(
185,000
to
the
public
at
$12.50
,
with
another
5,000
reserved
for
Morton
Foods
employes
at
$11.50
a
share
)
.
There
was
even
a
cable
in
French
from
a
bank
in
Switzerland
that
had
somehow
learned
about
the
Dallas
stock
offering
.
``
We
subscribe
500
shares
of
Morton
Foods
of
Texas
.
Cable
confirmation
''
,
it
said
translated
.
But
E.G.T.
could
not
let
the
Swiss
bank
have
even
10
shares
.
After
it
allotted
shares
to
41
underwriters
and
52
selling
group
members
from
coast
to
coast
there
were
not
many
shares
for
anyone
.
But
the
result
of
it
all
was
,
E.G.T.
partner
Dean
Guerin
believes
,
an
effective
distribution
of
the
stock
to
owners
all
over
the
nation
.
``
I
feel
confident
the
stock
will
qualify
for
the
'
national
list
'
''
,
he
said
,
meaning
its
market
price
would
be
quoted
regularly
in
newspapers
all
over
the
country
.
He
was
also
pleased
with
the
wide
distribution
because
he
thought
it
proved
again
his
argument
that
Dallas
investment
men
can
do
just
as
good
a
job
as
the
big
New
York
investment
bankers
claim
only
they
can
do
.
But
what
made
the
Morton
Foods
stock
issue
such
a
hot
one
?
?
The
answer
is
that
it
was
a
combination
of
circumstances
.
First
,
the
general
stock
market
has
been
boiling
upward
for
the
last
few
months
,
driving
stocks
of
all
kinds
up
.
As
a
result
,
it
is
not
easy
to
find
a
stock
priced
as
the
Morton
issue
was
priced
(
at
roughly
10
times
1960
earnings
,
to
yield
a
little
over
5
per
cent
on
the
64-cent
anticipated
dividend
)
.
Second
,
the
``
potato
chip
industry
''
has
caught
the
fancy
of
investors
lately
,
and
until
Morton
Foods
came
along
there
were
only
two
potato
chip
stocks
--
Frito
and
H.
W.
Lay
--
on
the
market
.
Both
of
those
have
had
dynamic
run-ups
in
price
on
the
market
in
recent
months
,
both
were
selling
at
higher
price-earnings
and
yield
bases
than
Morton
was
coming
to
market
at
,
and
everyone
who
knew
anything
about
it
expected
the
Morton
stock
to
have
a
fast
run-up
.
And
third
,
the
potato
chip
industry
has
taken
on
the
flavor
of
a
``
growth
''
industry
in
the
public
mind
of
late
.
Foods
,
which
long
had
been
considered
``
recession
resistant
''
but
hardly
dynamic
stocks
,
have
been
acting
like
growth
stocks
,
going
to
higher
price-earnings
ratios
.
The
potato
chip
industry
these
days
is
growing
,
not
only
as
a
result
of
population
increase
and
public
acceptance
of
convenience
foods
,
but
also
because
of
a
combination
of
circumstances
that
has
led
to
growth
by
merger
.
The
history
of
the
U.S.
potato
chip
industry
is
that
many
of
today's
successful
companies
got
started
during
the
deep
depression
days
.
Those
that
remain
are
those
that
were
headed
by
strong
executives
,
men
with
the
abilities
to
last
almost
30
years
in
the
competitive
survival
of
the
fittest
.
But
today
many
of
those
men
are
reaching
retirement
age
and
suddenly
realizing
that
they
face
an
estate
tax
problem
with
their
closely
held
companies
and
also
that
they
have
no
second-echelon
management
in
their
firms
.
So
they
go
looking
for
mergers
with
other
firms
that
have
publicly
quoted
stock
,
and
almost
daily
they
pound
on
the
doors
of
firms
like
Frito
.
All
those
things
combined
to
make
the
Morton
Foods
stock
the
hot
issue
that
it
was
and
is
.
Now
,
if
Morton's
newest
product
,
a
corn
chip
known
as
Chip-o's
,
turns
out
to
sell
as
well
as
its
stock
did
,
the
stock
may
turn
out
to
be
worth
every
cent
of
the
prices
that
the
avid
buyers
bid
it
up
to
.
Dallas
and
North
Texas
is
known
world-wide
as
the
manufacturing
and
distribution
center
of
cotton
gin
machinery
and
supplies
,
valued
in
the
millions
of
dollars
.
More
than
10
companies
maintain
facilities
in
Dallas
and
one
large
manufacturer
is
located
to
the
north
at
Sherman
.
It
is
no
coincidence
that
the
Texas
Cotton
Ginner's
Association
is
meeting
here
this
week
for
the
46th
time
in
their
52-year
history
.
The
exhibition
of
cotton
ginning
machinery
at
the
State
Fair
grounds
is
valued
at
more
than
a
million
dollars
.
It
weighs
in
the
tons
,
so
the
proximity
of
factory
and
exhibition
area
makes
it
possible
for
an
outstanding
exhibit
each
year
.
A
modern
cotton
gin
plant
costs
in
the
neighborhood
of
$250,000
,
and
it's
a
safe
assumption
that
a
large
percentage
of
new
gins
in
the
U.S.
and
foreign
countries
contain
machinery
made
in
this
area
.
The
Murray
Co.
of
Texas
,
Inc.
,
originated
in
Dallas
in
1896
.
They've
occupied
a
22-acre
site
since
the
early
1900's
.
More
than
700
employees
make
gin

New
car
sales
in
Dallas
County
during
March
showed
slight
signs
of
recovering
from
the
doldrums
which
have
characterized
sales
this
year
.
Registrations
of
new
cars
in
Dallas
County
cracked
the
3,000
mark
in
March
for
the
first
time
this
year
.
Totaling
3,399
,
sales
jumped
14
per
cent
over
February's
2,963
.
However
,
compared
with
March
1960
new
car
sales
of
4,441
,
this
March
was
off
23
per
cent
.
On
a
quarter-to-quarter
comparison
,
the
first
quarter
of
1961
total
of
9,273
cars
was
21
per
cent
behind
the
previous
year's
3-month
total
of
11,744
.
This
year-to-year
decline
for
Dallas
County
closely
follows
the
national
trend
--
estimated
sales
of
domestic
cars
in
the
U.S.
for
first
three
months
of
1961
were
about
1,212,000
or
80
per
cent
of
the
total
in
the
first
quarter
a
year
earlier
.
With
the
March
pickup
,
dealers
are
optimistic
that
the
April-June
quarter
will
equal
or
top
last
year
.
The
March
gain
plus
this
optimism
has
been
encouraging
enough
to
prompt
auto
makers
to
boost
production
schedules
for
the
next
quarter
.
On
the
local
level
,
compacts
continue
to
grab
a
larger
share
of
the
market
at
the
expense
of
lower-priced
standard
models
and
foreign
cars
.
Only
three
standard
models
--
Buick
,
Chrysler
,
and
Mercury
--
had
slight
year-to-year
gains
in
March
sales
in
the
county
.

``
The
present
recovery
movement
will
gather
steady
momentum
to
lift
the
economy
to
a
new
historic
peak
by
this
autumn
''
,
Beryl
W.
Sprinkel
,
economist
of
Harris
Trust
&
Savings
Bank
,
Chicago
,
predicted
at
the
closing
session
here
Tuesday
of
Investment
Bankers
Assn.
,
California
group
,
conference
.
Another
speaker
,
William
H.
Draper
,
Jr.
,
former
Under
Secretary
of
the
Army
and
now
with
the
Palo
Alto
venture
capital
firm
of
Draper
,
Gaither
&
Anderson
,
urged
the
U.S.
to
``
throw
down
the
gauntlet
of
battle
to
communism
and
tell
Moscow
bluntly
we
won't
be
pushed
around
any
more
''
.
He
urged
support
for
President
Kennedy's
requests
for
both
defense
and
foreign
aid
appropriations
.
'
not
flash
in
pan
'
Sprinkel
told
conferees
that
the
recent
improvement
in
economic
activity
was
not
a
``
temporary
flash
in
the
pan
''
but
the
beginning
of
a
substantial
cyclical
expansion
that
will
carry
the
economy
back
to
full
employment
levels
and
witness
a
renewal
of
our
traditional
growth
pattern
.
``
In
view
of
the
current
expansion
,
which
promises
to
be
substantial
''
he
said
the
odds
appear
to
favor
rising
interest
rates
in
coming
months
,
but
``
there
is
reason
to
believe
the
change
will
not
be
as
abrupt
as
in
1958
nor
as
severe
as
in
late
1959
and
1960
''
.
Thesis
refuted
Sprinkel
strongly
refuted
the
current
neo-stagnationist
thesis
that
we
are
facing
a
future
of
limited
and
slow
growth
,
declaring
that
this
pessimism
``
is
based
on
very
limited
and
questionable
evidence
''
.
Rather
than
viewing
the
abortive
recovery
in
1959-60
as
a
reason
for
believing
we
have
lost
prospects
for
growth
''
,
he
said
``
it
should
be
viewed
as
a
lesson
well
learned
which
will
increase
the
probability
of
substantial
improvement
in
this
recovery
''
.
Danger
cited
He
cautioned
that
``
the
greater
danger
in
this
recovery
may
be
excessive
stimulation
by
government
which
could
bring
moderate
inflation
''
.
The
economist
does
not
look
for
a
drastic
switch
in
the
budget
during
this
recovery
and
believes
it
``
even
more
unlikely
that
the
Federal
Reserve
will
aggressively
tighten
monetary
policy
in
the
early
phases
of
the
upturn
as
was
the
case
in
1958
''
.
The
unsatisfactory
1958-60
expansion
,
he
said
,
was
not
due
to
inadequate
growth
forces
inherent
in
our
economy
but
rather
to
the
adverse
effect
of
inappropriate
economic
policies
combined
with
retrenching
decisions
resulting
from
the
steel
strike
.
Sacrifices
needed
Draper
declared
,
``
As
I
see
it
,
this
country
has
never
faced
such
great
dangers
as
threaten
us
today
.
We
must
justify
our
heritage
.
We
must
be
ready
for
any
needed
sacrifice
''
.
He
said
that
from
his
experience
of
two
years
with
Gen.
Clay
in
West
Berlin
administration
,
that
``
Russia
respects
our
show
of
strength
,
but
that
presently
we're
not
acting
as
we
should
and
must
''
.
He
called
the
Cuban
tractor
plan
an
outright
blackmail
action
,
and
noted
that
in
war
``
you
can't
buy
yourself
out
and
that's
what
we're
trying
to
do
''
.
While
he
declined
to
suggest
,
how
,
he
said
that
sooner
or
later
we
must
get
rid
of
Castro
,
``
for
unless
we
do
we're
liable
to
face
similar
situations
in
this
hemisphere
.
Its
the
start
of
a
direct
threat
to
our
own
security
and
I
don't
believe
we
can
permit
that

New
York
(
AP
)
--
Stock
market
Tuesday
staged
a
technical
recovery
,
erasing
all
of
Monday's
losses
in
the
Associated
Press
average
and
making
the
largest
gain
in
about
two
weeks
.
Analysts
saw
the
move
as
a
continuation
of
the
recovery
drive
that
got
under
way
late
Monday
afternoon
when
the
list
sank
to
a
hoped-for
``
support
level
''
represented
by
around
675
in
the
Dow
Jones
industrial
average
.
It
was
a
level
at
which
some
of
the
investors
standing
on
the
sidelines
were
thought
likely
to
buy
the
pivotal
issues
represented
in
the
averages
.
Some
good
news
Although
it
looked
like
a
routine
technical
snapback
to
Wall
Streeters
it
was
accompanied
by
some
good
news
.
A
substantial
rise
in
new
orders
and
sales
of
durable
goods
was
reported
for
last
month
.
Treasury
Secretary
Douglas
Dillon
said
the
economy
is
expected
to
advance
by
a
whopping
8%
next
year
,
paving
the
way
for
lower
taxes
.
The
Dow
Jones
industrial
average
advanced
7.19
to
687.87
.
Of
1,253
issues
traded
,
695
advanced
and
354
declined
.
New
highs
for
the
year
totaled
nine
and
new
lows
14
.
Trading
was
comparatively
dull
throughout
the
day
.
Volume
dipped
to
3.28
million
shares
from
3.98
million
Monday
.
A
$25
billion
advertising
budget
in
an
$800
billion
economy
was
envisioned
for
the
1970s
here
Tuesday
by
Peter
G.
Peterson
,
head
of
one
of
the
world's
greatest
camera
firms
,
in
a
key
address
before
the
American
Marketing
Assn.
.
However
,
Peterson
,
president
of
Bell
&
Howell
,
warned
800
U.S.
marketing
leaders
attending
a
national
conference
at
the
Ambassador
,
that
the
future
will
belong
to
the
industrialist
of
creative
and
``
unconventional
wisdom
''
.
Creations
needed
``
As
we
look
to
the
$800
billion
economy
that
is
predicted
for
1970
and
the
increase
of
about
40%
in
consumer
expenditures
that
will
be
required
to
reach
that
goal
,
management
can
well
be
restless
about
how
this
tremendous
volume
and
number
of
new
products
will
be
created
and
marketed
''
,
Peterson
said
.
``
With
this
kind
of
new
product
log-jam
,
the
premium
for
brilliant
product
planning
will
obviously
go
up
geometrically
''
.
The
executive
paid
tribute
to
research
and
development
and
technology
for
their
great
contributions
in
the
past
,
but
he
also
cautioned
industry
that
they
tend
to
be
great
equalizers
because
they
move
at
a
fairly
even
pace
within
an
industry
and
fail
to
give
it
the
short-term
advantage
which
it
often
needs
.
Nothing
to
fear
Peterson
said
America
has
nothing
to
fear
in
world
competition
if
it
dares
to
be
original
in
both
marketing
and
product
ideas
.
He
cited
,
as
an
example
,
how
the
American
camera
industry
has
been
able
to
meet
successfully
the
competition
of
Japan
despite
lower
Japanese
labor
costs
,
by
improving
its
production
know-how
and
technology
.
He
also
used
as
an
example
the
manufacturer
who
introduced
an
all-automatic
camera
in
Germany
,
with
the
result
that
it
became
the
best
selling
camera
in
the
German
market
.

Answer

Write
to
the
fund's
custodian
bank
--
the
First
National
Bank
of
Jersey
City
,

That
bank
handles
most
of
the
paper
work
for
Diversified
Growth
Stock
Fund
,
Fundamental
Investors
,
Diversified
Investment
Fund
and
Television-Electronics
Fund
.
The
bank
installed
a
magnetic
tape
electronic
data
processing
system
to
handle
things
.
But
it
seems
that
this
``
electronic
brain
''
wasn't
``
programmed
''
correctly
.
This
resulted
in
a
great
number
of
errors
.
And
letters
began
to
come
in
to
this
column
from
irate
shareholders
.
I
visited
the
bank
in
March
and
wrote
a
story
about
the
situation
.
At
that
time
,
the
people
at
the
bank
said
they
felt
that
they
had
the
situation
in
hand
.
They
indicated
that
no
new
errors
were
being
made
and
that
all
old
errors
would
be
corrected
``
within
60
days
''
.
That
60-day
period
is
over
and
letters
are
still
coming
in
from
shareholders
of
these
four
funds
,
complaining
about
mistakes
in
their
accounts
.
Maybe
it's
taking
longer
to
get
things
squared
away
than
the
bankers
expected
.
Any
shareholder
of
any
of
these
funds
who
finds
a
mistake
in
his
account
certainly
should
get
in
touch
with
the
bank

Alfred

said
Tuesday
``
there
is
no
present
need
for
far-reaching
reforms
''
which
would
basically
alter
the
international
financial
system
.
Hayes
said
that
if

be
found
to
deal
effectively
with
short-term
capital
movements
between

,
``
there
is
no

said
Tuesday
his
line
would
face
the
threat
of
bankruptcy
if
the
Chesapeake

and
Baltimore

Railroads
merge
.
Perlman
said
bankruptcy
would
not
be
an
immediate
effect
of
the
merger
,
but
could
possibly
be
an
ultimate
effect
.
The
railroad
president
made
the
statement
in
an
interview
as
the
Interstate
Commerce
Commission
opened
Round
2
of
its
hearing
into
the

.
``
The

has
become
precarious
--
much
worse
than
at
any
time
since

he
told
the

``
Consumer
uncertain
about

conditions
''
.
This
was
the
chief
reason
for
a
so-so
sales
outlook
given
by
two-thirds
of
56
builders
polled
by
the
National
Housing
Center
.
Other
reasons
mentioned
by
one-third
or
more
of
the
builders
were
``
resistance
to
high
interest
rates
,
cost
advantage
of
buying
over
renting

narrowed
,
shelter
market
nearing
saturation
and
prospects
unable
to
qualify
''
.
Increase
expected
The
poll
was
taken
at
the
Center's
annual
builders'
intentions
conference
.
It
disclosed
that
the
builders
:
Expect
their
own
production
volume
,
and
presumably
sales
,
to
jump
30
percent
in
1961
.
Look
for
home
building
nationally
to
advance
less
than
10
percent
this
year
from
1960's
1,257,700
non-farm
housing
starts
.
The
industry
has
said
1960
was
a
poor
year
.
Starts
were
down
20
percent
from
1959
.
Why
the
discrepancy
between
the
builders'
forecasts
for
themselves
and
for
the
industry
?
?
Leaders
of
industry
The
reason
,
says
the
Housing
Center
,
is
that
the
builders
invited
to
the
intentions
conference
``
are
generally
among
the
more
successful
businessmen
,
and
usually
do
somewhat
better
than
their
fellow

Farm
machinery
dealer
Bob
Houtz
tilts
back
in
a
battered
chair
and
tells
of
a
sharp
pickup
in
sales
:
``
We've
sold
four
corn
pickers
since
Labor
Day
and
have
good
prospects
for
10
more
.
We
sold
only
four
pickers
all
last
year
''
.
Gus
Ehlers
,
competitor
of
Mr.
Houtz
in
this
farm
community
,
says
his
business
since
August
1
is
running
50%
above
a
year
earlier
.
``
Before
then
,
my
sales
during
much
of
the
year
had
lagged
behind
1960
by
20%
''
,
he
says
.
Though
the
sales
gains
these
two
dealers
are
experiencing
are
above
average
for
their
business
,
farm
equipment
sales
are
climbing
in
most
rural
areas
.
Paradoxically
,
the
sales
rise
is
due
in
large
measure
to
Government
efforts
to
slash
farm
output
.
Although
the
Administration's
program
cut
crop
acreage
to
the
lowest
point
since
1934
,
farmers
,
with
the
help
of
extra
fertilizer
and
good
weather
,
are
getting
such
high
yields
per
acre
that
many
are
being
forced
to
buy
new
harvesting
machines
.
Fields
of
corn
and
some
other
crops
in
many
cases
are
so
dense
that
older
equipment
cannot
handle
them
efficiently
.
The
higher
price
supports
provided
by
the
new
legislation
,
together
with
rising
prices
for
farm
products
,
are
pushing
up
farm
income
,
making
it
possible
for
farmers
to
afford
the
new
machinery
.
Seven
of
the
eight
companies
that
turn
out
full
lines
of
farm
machinery
say
sales
by
their
dealers
since
the
start
of
August
have
shown
gains
averaging
nearly
10%
above
last
year
.
``
In
August
our
dealers
sold
13%
more
farm
machinery
than
a
year
earlier
and
in
September
retail
sales
were
14%
higher
than
last
year
''
,
says
Mark
V.
Keeler
,
farm
equipment
vice
president
of
International
Harvester
Co.
.
For
the
year
to
date
,
sales
of
the
company's
farm
equipment
dealers
still
lag
about
5%
behind
1960
.
Two
of
three
report
gains
Among
individual
dealers
questioned
in
nearly
a
score
of
states
,
two
out
of
three
report
their
sales
since
August
1
show
sizable
gains
from
a
year
earlier
,
with
the
increases
ranging
from
5%
to
50%
.
Not
all
sections
are
showing
an
upswing
,
however
;
;
the
drought-seared
North
Central
states
are
the
most
notable
exceptions
to
the
uptrend
.
The
significance
of
the
pickup
in
farm
machinery
sales
extends
beyond
the
farm
equipment
industry
.
The
demand
for
farm
machinery
is
regarded
as
a
yardstick
of
rural
buying
generally
.
Farmers
spend
more
of
their
income
on
tractors
and
implements
than
on
any
other
group
of
products
.
More
than
20
million
people
live
on
farms
and
they
own
a
fourth
of
the
nation's
trucks
,
buy
more
gasoline
than
any
other
industry
and
provide
a
major
market
for
home
appliances
,
chemicals
and
other
products
.
Farmers
are
so
eager
for
new
machinery
that
they're
haggling
less
over
prices
than
they
did
a
year
ago
,
dealers
report
.
``
Farmers
aren't
as
price
conscious
as
last
year
so
we
can
get
more
money
on
a
sale
''
,
says
Jack
Martin
,
who
sells
J.
I.
Case
tractors
and
implements
in
Sioux
City
,
Iowa
.
``
This
morning
,
we
allowed
a
farmer
$600
on
the
old
picker
he
traded
in
on
a
new
$2,700
model
.
Last
year
,
we
probably
would
have
given
him
$700
for
a
comparable
machine
''
.
Mr.
Martin
sold
21
tractors
in
August
;
;
in
August
of
1960
,
he
sold
seven
.
Dealers'
stocks
down
With
dealer
stocks
of
new
equipment
averaging
about
25%
below
a
year
ago
,
the
affects
of
the
rural
recovery
are
being
felt
almost
immediately
by
the
country's
farm
equipment
manufacturers
.
For
example
,
farm
equipment
shipments
of
International
Harvester
in
August
climbed
about
5%
above
a
year
earlier
,
Mr.
Keeler
reports
.
Tractor
production
at
Massey-Ferguson
,
Ltd.
,
of
Toronto
in
July
and
August
rose
to
2,418
units
from
869
in
the
like
period
a
year
earlier
,
says
John
Staiger
,
vice
president
.
With
the
lower
dealer
inventories
and
the
stepped-up
demand
some
manufacturers
believe
there
could
be
shortages
of
some
implements
.
Merritt
D.
Hill
,
Ford
Motor
Co.
vice
president
,
says
his
company
is
starting
to
get
calls
daily
from
dealers
demanding
immediate
delivery
or
wanting
earlier
shipping
dates
on
orders
for
corn
pickers
.
Except
for
a
few
months
in
late
1960
and
early
1961
,
retail
farm
equipment
sales
have
trailed
year-earlier
levels
since
the
latter
part
of
1959
.
The
rise
in
sales
last
winter
was
checked
when
the
Government's
new
feed
grain
program
was
adopted
;
;
the
program
resulted
in
a
cutback
of
around
20%
in
planted
acreage
and
,
as
a
result
,
reduced
the
immediate
need
for
machines
.
Nearly
all
of
the
farm
equipment
manufacturers
and
dealers
say
the
upturn
in
sales
has
resulted
chiefly
from
the
recent
improvement
in
crop
prospects
.
Total
farm
output
for
this
year
is
officially
forecast
at
129%
of
the
1947-49
average
,
three
points
higher
than
the
July
1
estimate
and
exactly
equal
to
the
final
figure
for
1960
.
The
Government
also
is
aiding
farmers'
income
prospects
.
Agriculture
Department
economists
estimate
the
Government
this
year
will
hand
farmers
$1.4
billion
in
special
subsidies
and
incentive
payments
,
well
above
the
record
$1.1
billion
of
1958
and
about
double
the
$639
million
of
1960
.
Price
support
loans
may
total
another
$1
billion
this
year
.
With
cash
receipts
from
marketings
expected
to
be
slightly
above
1960
,
farmers'
gross
income
is
estimated
at
$39.5
billion
,
$1.5
billion
above
1960's
record
high
.
Net
income
may
reach
$12.7
billion
,
up
$1
billion
from
1960
and
the
highest
since
1953
.
The
Government
reported
last
week
that
the
index
of
prices
received
by
farmers
rose
in
the
month
ended
at
mid-September
for
the
third
consecutive
month
,
reaching
242%
of
the
1910-14
average
compared
with
237%
at
mid-July
.
Kennedy
opposes
any
widespread
relief
from
a
High
Court
depletion
ruling
.
The
Supreme
Court
decision
in
mid-1960
was
in
the
case
of
a
company
making
sewer
pipe
from
clay
which
it
mined
.
The
company
,
in
figuring
its
taxable
earnings
,
deducted
a
percentage
of
the
revenue
it
received
for
its
finished
products
.
Such
``
depletion
allowances
''
,
in
the
form
of
percentages
of
sales
are
authorized
by
tax
law
for
specified
raw
materials
producers
using
up
their
assets
.
The
High
Court
held
that
the
company
must
apply
its
percentage
allowance
to
the
value
of
the
raw
materials
removed
from
the
ground
,
not
to
the
revenue
from
finished
products
.
A
measure
passed
by
Congress
just
before
adjourning
softened
the
ruling's
impact
,
on
prior-year
returns
still
under
review
,
for
clay-mining
companies
that
make
brick
and
tile
products
.
The
measure
allows
such
companies
in
those
years
to
apply
their
mineral
depletion
allowances
to
50%
of
the
value
of
the
finished
products
rather
than
the
lower
value
of
raw
clay
alone
.
President
Kennedy
,
in
signing
the
relief
measure
into
law
,
stressed
he
regarded
it
as
an
exception
.
``
My
approval
of
this
bill
should
not
be
viewed
as
establishing
a
precedent
for
the
enactment
of
similar
legislation
for
other
mineral
industries
''
,
the
President
said
.
Charitable
deductions
come
in
for
closer
scrutiny
by
the
I.R.S.
.
The
Service
announced
that
taxpayers
making
such
claims
may
be
called
on
to
furnish
a
statement
from
the
recipient
organization
showing
the
date
,
purpose
,
amount
and
other
particulars
of
the
contribution
.
Requests
for
substantiation
,
the
Service
indicated
,
can
be
especially
expected
in
cases
where
it
suspects
the
donor
received
some
material
benefit
in
return
,
such
as
tickets
to
a
show
.
In
such
an
instance
,
revenuers
stressed
,
the
deduction
must
be
reduced
by
the
value
of
the
benefit
received
.
A
rule
on
the
Federal
deductibility
of
state
taxes
is
contested
.
A
realty
corporation
in
Louisiana
owed
no
tax
,
under
Federal
law
,
on
its
gain
from
the
sale
of
property
disposed
of
in
line
with
a
plan
of
liquidation
.
Louisiana
,
however
,
collected
an
income
tax
on
the
profits
from
the
sale
.
The
corporation
,
in
filing
its
final
Federal
income
return
,
claimed
the
state
tax
payment
as
a
deductible
expense
,
as
permitted
under
U.S.
tax
law
.
The
Revenue
Service
disallowed
the
claim
,
invoking
a
law
provision
that
generally
bars
deductions
for
expenses
incurred
in
connection
with
what
it
said
was
tax-exempt
income
.
The
Tax
Court
rejected
this
view
.
It
said
the
tax-freedom
of
the
gain
in
this
case
stemmed
not
from
the
exempt
status
of
the
income
but
from
a
special
rule
on
corporate
liquidations
.
The
Tax
Court
decision
and
a
similar
earlier
finding
by
the
Ninth
Circuit
Court
of
Appeals
challenges
a
year-old
I.R.S.
ruling
on
the
subject
.
The
Service
has
not
said
what
its
next
step
will
be
.
Peace
Corps
volunteers
are
assured
a
tax
benefit
under
the
law
creating
the
agency
.
It
provides
that
the
$1,800
termination
payment
each
cadet
is
to
get
,
after
serving
a
two-year
hitch
without
pay
,
will
be
spread
over
both
years
,
not
taxed
in
its
entirety
at
a
possibly
higher
rate
in
the
year
received
.
The
owner
of
a
public
relations
firm
owed
no
income
tax
on
payments
he
received
from
a
client
company
and
``
kicked
back
''
to
the
company's
advertising
manager
,
the
Tax
Court
ruled
.
The
taxpayer
testified
that
in
order
to
retain
the
account
he
had
to
pad
his
invoices
and
pay
the
excess
to
the
manager
.
The
Court
upheld
the
taxpayer's
contention
that
these
``
kickbacks
''
were
not
his
income
though
they
passed
through
his
hands
.
The
Court
limited
its
decision
to
the
tax
issue
involved
,
commenting
:
``
It
is
not
our
province
to
pass
judgment
on
the
morality
of
the
transaction
''

to
keep
it
from
moving
with
the
motion
of
the
vessel
.
The
Revenue
Service
said
the
addition
of
the
attachment
does
not
keep
the
range
from
coming
under
the
Federal
manufacturers'
excise
tax
on
household-type
appliances
.
Hiring
the
wife
for
one's
company
may
win
her
tax-aided
retirement
income
.
A
spouse
employed
by
a
corporation
her
husband
controls
,
for
example
,
may
be
entitled
to
distributions
under
the
company's
pension
plan
as
well
as
to
her
own
Social
Security
coverage
.
She
would
be
taxed
on
the
pensions
when
received
,
of
course
,
but
the
company's
contributions
would
be
tax-free
.
A
frequent
pitfall
in
this
sort
of
arrangement
,
experts
warn
,
is
a
tendency
to
pay
the
wife
more
than
her
job
is
worth
and
to
set
aside
an
excessive
amount
for
her
as
retirement
income
.
In
that
event
,
they
note
,
the
Revenue
Service
might
declare
the
pension
plan
is
discriminatory
and
deny
it
tax
privileges
under
the
law
.
Possible
upshots
:
The
company
could
be
denied
a
deduction
for
its
pension
payments
,
or
those
payments
for
the
wife
and
other
employes
could
be
ruled
taxable
to
them
in
the
year
made
.
State
briefs
:
Voters
in
four
counties
containing
and
bordering
Denver
authorized
the
imposition
of
an
additional
2%
sales
tax
within
that
area
.
Colorado
has
a
2%
sales
tax
.
Denver
itself
collects
a
1%
sales
tax
which
is
to
be
absorbed
in
the
higher
area
tax
.
The
Washington
state
supreme
court
ruled
that
the
state's
occupation
tax
applied
to
sales
,
made
at
cost
to
an
oil
company
,
by
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary
set
up
to
purchase
certain
supplies
without
divulging
the
identity
of
the
parent
.
The
state's
occupation
tax
is
computed
on
gross
sales
.
The
court
held
that
the
tax
applied
to
non-profit
sales
because
the
corporations
realized
economic
benefits
by
doing
business
as
two
separate
entities
.
Washington
--
Consumer
spending
edged
down
in
April
after
rising
for
two
consecutive
months
,
the
Government
reported
.
The
Commerce
Department
said
seasonally
adjusted
sales
of
retail
stores
dropped
to
slightly
under
$18
billion
in
April
,
down
1%
from
the
March
level
of
more
than
$18.2
billion
.
April
sales
also
were
5%
below
those
of
April
last
year
,
when
volume
reached
a
record
for
any
month
,
$18.9
billion
(
see
chart
on
Page
One
)
.
The
seasonal
adjustment
takes
into
account
such
factors
as
Easter
was
on
April
2
this
year
,
two
weeks
earlier
than
in
1960
,
and
pre-Easter
buying
was
pushed
into
March
.
Commerce
Department
officials
were
inclined
to
explain
the
April
sales
decline
as
a
reaction
from
a
surge
of
consumer
buying
in
March
.
Adjusted
sales
that
month
were
up
a
relatively
steep
2.5%
from
those
of
the
month
before
,
which
in
turn
were
slightly
higher
than
the
January
low
of
$17.8
billion
.
Greer
Garson
,
world-famous
star
of
stage
,
screen
and
television
,
will
be
honored
for
the
high
standard
in
tasteful
sophisticated
fashion
with
which
she
has
created
a
high
standard
in
her
profession
.
As
a
Neiman-Marcus
award
winner
the
titian-haired
Miss
Garson
is
a
personification
of
the
individual
look
so
important
to
fashion
this
season
.
She
will
receive
the
1961
``
Oscar
''
at
the
24th
annual
Neiman-Marcus
Exposition
,
Tuesday
and
Wednesday
in
the
Grand
Ballroom
of
the
Sheraton-Dallas
Hotel
.
The
only
woman
recipient
,
Miss
Garson
will
receive
the
award
with
Ferdinando
Sarmi
,
creator
of
chic
,
beautiful
women's
fashions
;
;
Harry
Rolnick
,
president
of
the
Byer-Rolnick
Hat
Corporation
and
designer
of
men's
hats
;

Sydney
Wragge
,
creator
of
sophisticated
casuals

women
and
Roger
Vivier
,
designer
of
Christian
Dior
shoes
Paris
,
France
,
whose
squared
toes
and
lowered
heels
have
revolutionized
the
shoe
industry
.
The
silver
and
ebony
plaques
will
be
presented
at
noon
luncheons
by
Stanley
Marcus
,
president
of
Neiman-Marcus

Beneficiary
of
the
proceeds
from
the
two
showings
will
be
the
Dallas
Society
for
Crippled
Children
Cerebral
Palsy

Center
.
The
attractive
Greer
Garson
,
who
loves
beautiful
clothes
and
selects
them
as
carefully
as
she
does
her
professional
roles
,
prefers
timeless
classical
designs
.
Occasionally
she
deserts
the
simple
and
elegant
for
a
fun
piece
simply
because
``
It's
unlike
me
''
.
In
private
life
,
Miss
Garson
is
Mrs.
E.
E.
Fogelson
and
on
the
go
most
of
the
time
commuting
from
Dallas
,
where
they
maintain
an
apartment
,
to
their
California
home
in
Los
Angeles'
suburban
Bel-Air
to
their
ranch
in
Pecos
,
New
Mexico
.
Therefore
,
her
wardrobe
is
largely
mobile
,
to
be
packed
at
a
moment's
notice
and
to
shake
out
without
a
wrinkle
.
Her
creations
in
fashion
are
from
many
designers
because
she
doesn't
want
a
complete
wardrobe
from
any
one
designer
any
more
than
she
wants
``
all
of
her
pictures
by
one
painter
''
.
A
favorite
is
Norman
Norell
,
however
.
She
likes
his
classic
chemise
.
Her
favorite
cocktail
dress
is
a
Norell
,
a
black
and
white
organdy
and
silk
jersey
.
Irene
suits
rate
high
because
they
are
designed
for
her
long-bodied
silhouette
.
She
also
likes
the
femininity
and
charm
of
designs
by
Ceil
Chapman
and
Helen
Rose
.
Balenciaga
is
her
favorite
European
designer
.
``
I
bought
my
first
dress
from
him
when
I
was
still
a
struggling
young
actress
''
,
she
reminisces
.
``
I
like
his
clothes
for
their
drama
and
simplicity
and
appreciate
the
great
impact
he
has
on
fashion
''
.
Black
and
white
is
her
favorite
color
combination
along
with
lively
glowing
pinks
,
reds
,
blues
and
greens
.
Of
Scotch-Irish-Scandinavian
descent
,
Greer
Garson
was
born
in
County
Down
,
Ireland
.
Her
mother
was
a
Greer
and
her
father's
family
came
from
the
Orkney
Isles
.
Reared
in
England
,
she
studied
to
be
a
teacher
,
earned
several
scholarships
and
was
graduated
with
honors
from
the
University
of
London
.
She
took
postgraduate
work
at
the
University
of
Grenoble
in
France
and
then
returned
to
London
to
work
on
market
research
with
an
advertising
firm
.
Her
acting
began
with
the
Birmingham
Repertory
Company
and
she
soon
became
the
toast
of
the
West
End
.
Among
stage
performances
was
a
starring
role
in
``
Golden
Arrow
''
directed
by
Noel
Coward
.
It
was
during
``
Old
Music
''
at
the
St.
James
Theater
that
Hollywood's
Louis
B.
Mayer
spotted
her
.
After
signing
a
motion-picture
contract
,
she
came
to
America
and
had
``
Goodbye
,
Mr.
Chips
''
as
her
first
assignment
after
a
year's
wait
.
Other
triumphs
include
``
Random
Harvest
''
,
``
Madame
Curie
''
,
``
Pride
and
Prejudice
''
,
``
The
Forsythe
Saga
''
and
``
Mrs.
Miniver
''
(
which
won
her
the
Academy
Award
in
1943
)
.
Honors
that
have
come
to
Greer
Garson
are
countless
.
Just
this
April
she
was
nominated
for
the
seventh
time
for
an
Academy
Award
for
her
portrayal
of
Eleanor
Roosevelt
in
``
Sunrise
at
Campobello
''
.
She
gave
a
fine
portrayal
of
Auntie
Mame
on
Broadway
in
1958
and
has
appeared
in
live
television
from
``
Captain
Brassbound's
Conversion
''
to
``
Camille
''
.
She
is
in
Madame
Tussard's
Waxworks
in
London
,
a
princess
of
the
Kiowa
tribe
and
an
honorary
colonel
in
many
states
.
She
is
adept
at
skeet
shooting
,
trout
fishing
,
Afro-Cuban
and
Oriental
dancing
and
Southwestern
archaeology
.
She
now
serves
on
the
board
of
directors
of
the
Dallas
Symphony
Orchestra
and
the
Dallas
Theater
Center
and
on
the
board
of
trustees
of
the
Dallas
Museum
of
Fine
Arts
.
She
is
state
chairman
for
the
New
Mexico
Tuberculosis
and
Cancer
Associations
.
Both
Miss
Garson
and
her
oilman-rancher
husband
are
active
supporters
of
Boys
Clubs
of
America
and
patrons
of
the
vivid
art
and
opera
colony
that
flourishes
in
New
Mexico
.
Back
in
college
,
today's
handsome
Gander
was
the
only
male
member
of
a
Texas
Tech
class
on
food
.
The
pretty
coeds
must
have
ogled
him
all
day
long
--
but
he
dutifully
kept
his
eye
on
the
gravy
.
Last
October
he
gave
a
public
speech
in
Washington
,
D.C.
entitled
``
Are
Women
Here
To
Stay
''
?
?
So
you
can
see
that
Gerald
G.
Ramsey
,
director
of
SMU's
food
services
,
is
not
the
ordinary
type
of
craven
,
women-trodden
chef
.
He
is
apt
to
rear
back
and
claim
his
rights
.
Ramsey
,
as
SMU's
food
wrangler
,
buys
enough
groceries
to
serve
32,000
meals
a
week
.
Tell
that
to
the
little
wife
when
she
moans
at
the
woman's
burden
!
!
He
also
dishes
up
3,000
snacks
.
And
he
operates
three
cafeterias
in
the
Student
Center
,
along
with
McElvaney
Dining
Hall
and
the
athlete's
tables
.
Ramsey
,
6-3
,
195
and
ruggedly
slim
,
says
,
``
I
can't
remember
when
I
didn't
pester
my
mother
to
teach
me
to
cook
''
.
He
was
in
charge
of
the
Hockaday
School
meals
from
1946
to
1950
,
before
he
moved
to
Aj
.
And
you'll
notice
that
in
both
places
,
there
are
acres
of
charming
young
ladies
who
with
little
effort
spice
up
any
chow
line
.
What
does
he
feed
his
SMU
football
mastodons
at
the
training
table
?
?
``
Mostly
meat
and
potatoes
--
they
have
to
have
that
go-go-go
without
getting
too
fat
''
,
says
Ramsey
.
So
he
hides
the
mayonnaise
.
And
to
keep
athletes'
stomachs
from
getting
jumpy
under
physical
duress
,
he
bans
all
highly
flavored
condiments
.
What
do
the
pretty
SMU
girls
like
on
their
plates
?
?
``
Pretty
much
hamburger
,
hotdogs
,
steak
and
,
at
night
,
maybe
pizza
''
,
says
the
handsome
food
expert
.
``
Unfortunately
,
there
is
still
little
demand
for
broccoli
and
cauliflower
''
.
Ramsey
has
stoked
up
Harry
Truman
,
Henry
Cabot
Lodge
,
the
King
of
Morocco
,
Clement
Atlee
and
other
shiny
characters
.
Once
four
Tibetan
monks
,
in
their
saffron
robes
,
filed
through
the
cafeteria
line
.
``
They
aren't
supposed
to
look
at
women
,
you
know
''
,
Ramsey
recalled
.
``
What
with
all
those
pretty
girls
around
,
they
had
a
hard
time
''
.
Chicken
Cadillac
Use
one
6-ounce
chicken
breast
for
each
guest
.
Salt
and
pepper
each
breast
.
Dip
in
melted
butter
and
roll
in
flour
.
Place
side
by
side
in
a
2-inch
deep
baking
pan
.
Bake
slowly
about
one
hour
at
250-275
F.
until
lightly
brown
.
Add
enough
warmed
cream
,
seasoned
to
taste
with
onion
juice
,
to
about
half
cover
the
chicken
breasts
.
Bake
slowly
at
least
one-half
hour
longer
.
While
this
is
baking
,
saute
mushrooms
,
fresh
or
canned
,
in
butter
.
Sprinkle
over
top
of
chicken
breasts
.
Serve
each
breast
on
a
thin
slice
of
slow-baked
ham
and
sprinkle
with
Thompson
seedless
grapes
.
(
Leave
off
the
ham
and
you
call
it
Chicken
Pontiac
,
says
Ramsey
.
)
Contemporary
furniture
that
is
neither
Danish
nor
straight-line
modern
but
has
sculptured
pattern
,
many
design
facets
,
warmth
,
dignity
and
an
effect
of
utter
comfort
and
livability
.
That
is
the
goal
of
two
new
collections
being
introduced
in
Dallas
this
month
.
Though
there
has
been
some
avant
garde
indication
that
contemporary
furniture
might
go
back
to
the
boxy
look
of
the
'20's
and
'40's
,
two
manufacturers
chose
to
take
the
approach
of
the
sophisticated
,
but
warm
look
in
contemporary
.
These
two
,
Heritage
and
Drexel
,
chose
too
not
to
produce
the
exactly
matching
design
for
every
piece
,
but
a
collection
of
correlated
designs
,
each
of
which
could
stand
alone
.
The
Heritage
collection
,
to
be
shown
by
Sanger-Harris
and
Anderson's
Studio
,
has
perhaps
more
different
types
of
woods
and
decorations
than
any
one
manufacturer
ever
assembled
together
at
one
time
.
Called
Perennian
,
to
indicate
its
lasting
,
good
today
and
tomorrow
quality
,
the
collection
truly
avoids
the
monotony
of
identical
pieces
.
Walnut
,
wormy
chestnut
,
pecan
,
three
varieties
of
burl
,
hand-woven
Philippine
cane
,
ceramic
tiles
,
marble
are
used
to
emphasize
the
feeling
of
texture
and
of
permanence
,
the
furniture
to
fit
into
rooms
with
tiled
floors
,
brick
or
paneled
walls
,
windows
that
bring
in
the
outdoors
.
It
is
a
collection
with
a
custom-design
look
,
offering
simplicity
with
warmth
,
variety
and
vitality
.
The
Drexel
collection
,
called
Composite
,
to
be
shown
by
Titche's
offers
a
realistic
approach
to
decorating
,
a
mature
modern
that
is
a
variation
of
many
designs
.
Rounded
posts
give
a
soft
,
sculptured
look
,
paneled
doors
have
decorative
burl
panels
or
cane
insets
plus
softening
arches
,
table
tops
are
inlaid
in
Macassar
ebony
or
acacia
.
A
high-legged
buffet
provides
easy-to-reach
serving
,
a
cocktail
table
has
small
snack
tables
tucked
under
each
end
,
recessed
arched
panels
decorate
a
60-inch
long
chest
.
An
interesting
approach
to
the
bedroom
is
presented
,
with
a
young
,
basic
,
functional
group
of
chests
,
dressers
and
corner
units
and
a
canted
headboard
.
The
other
bedroom
has
heavier
styling
,
door-fronted
dressers
with
acacia
panels
,
a
poster
bed
or
a
bed
with
arched
acacia
panels
and
matching
mirror
.
Colorful
,
bright
Eastman
Chromspun
fabrics
,
with
the
magenta
,
pink
and
white
tones
predominating
as
well
as
golden
shades
are
used
with
Composite
.
The
fabrics
have
Scotchgard
finish
to
resist
soil
and
wrinkles
.
Design

rooted
to
traditional
forms

wearing
a
definite

group

The
spider-leg
pedestal
table
has
a
base
finished
in
an
ebony
,
to
set
off
the
lustrous
brown
of
the
walnut
top
.
See-through
design
of
the
chairs
combines
both
the
nostalgic
ladder
back
and
an
Oriental
shoji
flavor
.
To
bring
warmth
to

golden

Members
are
on
their
way
to
Saledo
,
not
by
stage
coach
,
but
in
air-conditioned
cars
.
This
coming
weekend
they
have
reserved
the
entire
Stagecoach
Inn
and
adjoining
country
club
,
Saledo
,
for
festivities
.
Invitations
have
been
extended
to
some

The
get-together
Friday

will
be
a
banquet
at
the
country

and
an
orchestra
will
play
for
dancing

Guests
will
wear
costumes

of
the
Chisholm

Guests
from

honor
Dr.
Swim
When
Dr.
W.
A.
Swim
celebrated
his
75th
birthday
at
the
Wilshire
Country
Club
,
guests
came
by
chartered
plane
from
all
over
the
country
.
A
flight
originating
in
Florida
picked
up
guests
on
the
East
Coast
and
Midwest
and
a
plane
left
from
Seattle
taking
on
passengers
at
West
Coast
points
.
Cocktails
and
a
buffet
supper
were
served
to
more
than
100
persons
who
had
known
Dr.
Swim
when
he
practiced
in
Los
Angeles
.
He
started
practice
in
1917
,
and
served
on
the
State
Board
of
Medical
Examiners
.
Giving
up
the
violin
opened
a
whole
new
career
for
Ilona
Schmidl-Seeberg
,
a
tiny
Hungarian
who
Fritz
Kreisler
had
predicted
would
have
a
promising
career
on
the
concert
stage
.
A
heart
attack
when
she
was
barely
20
put
an
end
to
the
10-hour
daily
practicing
.
She
put
the
violin
away
and
took
out
some
linen
,
needles
and
yarn
to
while
away
the
long
,
idle
days
in
Budapest
.
Now
her
modern
tapestries
have
been
exhibited
on
two
continents
and
,
at
26
,
she
feels
she
is
on
the
threshold
of
a
whole
new
life
in
Los
Angeles
.
Her
days
as
an
art
student
at
the
University
of
Budapest
came
to
a
sudden
end
during
the
Hungarian
uprisings
in
1957
and
she
and
her
husband
Stephen
fled
to
Vienna
.
There
they
continued
their
studies
at
the
university
,
she
in
art
,
he
in
architecture
.
And
there
she
had
her
first
showing
of
tapestry
work
.
There's
a
lot
of
talk
about
the
problem
of
education
in
America
today
.
What
most
people
don't
seem
to
realize
,
if
they
aren't
tied
up
with
the
thing
as
I
am
,
is
that
90%
of
the
problem
is
transportation
.
I
never
dreamed
of
the
logistical
difficulties
involved
until
,
at
long
last
,
both
of
my
boys
got
squeezed
into
high
school
.
It
seems
like
only
last
year
that
we
watched
them
set
out
up
the
hill
hand
in
hand
on
a
rainy
day
in
their
yellow
raincoats
to
finger-paint
at
the
grammar
school
.
Getting
to
and
from
school
was
no
problem
.
They
either
walked
or
were
driven
.
Now
they
go
to
a
high
school
that
is
two
miles
away
.
One
might
think
the
problem
would
be
similar
.
They
could
walk
,
ride
on
a
bus
or
be
driven
.
It's
much
more
complex
than
that
.
Generally
,
they
go
to
school
with
a
girl
named
Gloriana
,
who
lives
down
the
block
,
and
has
a
car
.
This
is
a
way
of
getting
to
school
,
but
,
I
understand
,
it
entails
a
certain
loss
of
social
status
.
A
young
man
doesn't
like
to
be
driven
up
in
front
of
a
school
in
a
car
driven
by
a
girl
who
isn't
even
in
a
higher
class
than
he
is
,
and
is
also
a
girl
.
``
Why
don't
you
walk
to
school
then
''
?
?
I
suggested
.
``
My
father
walked
,
through
two
miles
of
snow
,
in
Illinois
''
.
``
Did
you
''
?
?
I
was
asked
.
``
No
''
,
I
said
,
``
I
didn't
happen
to
grow
up
in
Illinois
''
.
I
explained
,
however
,
that
I
had
my
share
of
hardship
in
making
my
daily
pilgrimage
to
the
feet
of
wisdom
.
I
had
to
ride
a
streetcar
two
miles
.
Sometimes
the
streetcar
was
late
.
Sometimes
there
weren't
even
any
seats
.
I
had
to
stand
up
,
with
the
ladies
.
Sometimes
I
got
on
the
wrong
car
and
didn't
get
to
school
at
all
,
but
wound
up
at
the
ocean
,
or
some
other
dismal
place
,
and
had
to
spend
the
day
there
.
I've
tried
to
compromise
by
letting
them
take
the
little
car
now
and
then
.
When
they
do
that
my
wife
has
to
drive
me
to
work
in
the
big
car
.
She
has
to
have
at
least
one
car
herself
.
I
feel
a
certain
loss
of
status
when
I
am
driven
up
in
front
of
work
in
a
car
driven
by
my
wife
,
who
is
only
a
woman
.
Even
that
isn't
satisfactory
.
If
they
have
to
take
any
car
,
they'd
rather
take
the
big
one
.
They
say
that
when
they
take
a
car
,
Gloriana
doesn't
take
her
car
,
but
rides
with
them
.
But
when
Gloriana
rides
with
them
they
also
have
to
take
the
two
girls
who
usually
ride
with
her
,
so
the
little
car
isn't
big
enough
.
The
logic
of
that
is
impeccable
,
of
course
,
except
that
I
feel
like
a
fool
being
driven
up
to
work
in
a
little
car
,
by
my
wife
,
when
everybody
knows
I
have
a
big
car
and
am
capable
of
driving
myself
.
The
solution
,
naturally
,
is
the
bus
.
However
,
it's
a
half-mile
walk
down
a
steep
hill
from
our
house
to
the
bus
,
and
it's
too
hard
on
my
legs
.
My
wife
could
drive
us
down
the
hill
and
we
could
all
walk
from
there
.
But
that's
hardly
realistic
.
Nobody
walks
anymore
but
crackpots
and
Harry
Truman
,
and
he's
already
got
an
education
.

Newcomers

note
from

the
Ray
Carbones
,
formerly
of
Panama
;
;
the

formerly

,
and
Mr.
and

H.
Althaus

Here's
an
idea
for
a
child's
room
that
is
easy
to
execute
and
is
completely
charming
,
using
puppets
for
lamp
bases
.
Most
children
love
the
animated
puppet
faces
and
their
flexible
bodies
,
and
they
prefer
to
see
them
as
though
the
puppets
were
in
action
,
rather
than
put
away
in
boxes
.
Displayed
as
lamps
,
the
puppets
delight
the
children
and
are
decorative
accent
.
To
create
such
a
lamp
,
order
a
wired
pedestal
from
any
lamp
shop
.
Measure
the
puppet
to
determine
the
height
of
the
light
socket
,
allowing
three
to
four
inches
above
the
puppet's
head
.
Make
sure
that
the
metal
tube
through
which
the
wire
passes
is
in
the
shape
of
an
inverted
``
L
''
,
the
foot
of
the
``
L
''
about
three
inches
long
,
so
that
the
puppet
can
hang
directly
under
the
light
.
Pulling
strings
Using
the
strings
that
manipulate
the
puppet
,
suspend
him
from
the
light
fixture
by
tying
the
strings
to
the
lamp
base
.
In
this
way
,
you
can
arrange
his
legs
and
arms
in
any
desired
position
,
with
feet
,
or
one
foot
,
barely
resting
on
the
pedestal
.
If
the
puppets
are
of
uniform
size
,
you
can
change
them
in
accord
with
your
child's
whims
.
Although
a
straight
drum
shade
would
be
adequate
and
sufficiently
neutral
that
the
puppets
could
be
changed
without
disharmony
,
it
is
far
more
fun
to
create
shades
in
the
gay
spirit
of
a
child's
playtime
.
Those
illustrated
are
reminiscent
of
a
circus
top
or
a
merry-go-round
.
The
scalloped
edge
is
particularly
appealing
.
Today's
trend
toward
furniture
designs
from
America's
past
is
teaching
home-owners
and
decorators
a
renewed
respect
for
the
shrewd
cabinetmakers
of
our
Colonial
era
.
A
generation
ago
there
were
plenty
of
people
who
appreciated
antiques
and
fine
reproductions
.
In
the
background
lurked
the
feeling
,
however
,
that
these
pieces
,
beautiful
as
they
were
,
lacked
the
utilitarian
touch
.
So
junior's
bedroom
was
usually
tricked
out
with
heavy
,
nondescript
pieces
that
supposedly
could
take
the
``
hard
knocks
''
,
while
the
fine
secretary
was
relegated
to
the
parlor
where
it
was
for
show
only
.
This
isn't
true
of
the
many
homemakers
of
the
1960's
,
according
to
decorator
consultant
,
Leland
Alden
.
Housewives
are
finding
literally
hundreds
of
ways
of
getting
the
maximum
use
out
of
traditional
designs
,
says
Mr.
Alden
and
they
are
doing
it
largely
because
Colonial
craftsmen
had
``
an
innate
sense
of
the
practical
''
.
Solid
investment
There
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
the
Eighteenth
Century
designer
had
to
develop
``
down
to
earth
''
designs
--
or
go
out
of
business
.

Is
there
anything
a
frustrated
individual
can
do
about
Communism's
growing
threat
on
our
doorstep
and
around
the
world
?
?
More
than
300
teenagers
last
Sunday
proved
there
is
and
as
many
more
are
expected
to
prove
it
again
for
Jim
Kern
and
his
wife
Lynn
from
4
to
8
p.m.
Sunday
at
First
Presbyterian
Church
.
At
that
time
the
second
half
of
the
Christian
Youth
Crusade
against
Communism
will
be
staged
.
A
young
real
estate
salesman
,
Kern
first
got
seriously
interested
in
the
problems
posed
by
Communism
when
in
the
Navy
Air
Force
.
He
was
particularly
struck
by
a
course
on
Communist
brainwashing
.
Kern
began
reading
a
lot
about
the
history
and
philosophy
of
Communism
,
but
never
felt
there
was
anything
he
,
as
an
individual
,
could
do
about
it
.
When
he
attended
the
Christian
Anti-Communist
Crusade
school
here
about
six
months
ago
,
Jim
became
convinced
that
an
individual
can
do
something
constructive
in
the
ideological
battle
and
set
out
to
do
it
.
The
best
approach
,
he
figured
,
was
to
try
to
influence
young
people
like
the
high
schoolers
he
and
his
wife
serve
as
advisors
at
First
Presbyterian
Church
.
And
he
wanted
to
be
careful
that
the
kids
not
only
learn
about
Communist
but
also
about
what
he
feels
is
the
only
antidote
--
a
Biblically
strong
Christianity
.
So
the
Christian
Youth
Crusade
against
Communisn
developed
and
more
than
300
top
teenagers
and
65
adult
advisers
from
Presbyterian
churches
of
the
area
sat
enthralled
at
the
four-hour
program
.
This
Sunday
those
attending
the
second
session
will
hear
a
lecture
by
Kern
on
the
world
situation
;
;
a
review
of
the
philosophy
of
Communist
leaders
by
Ted
Slack
,
another
real
estate
agent
who
became
interested
as
a
philosophy
major
at
the
University
of
Miami
;
;
and
talks
on
how
their
Christian
faith
can
guide
them
in
learning
about
and
fighting
Communism
during
high
school
and
college
days
,
by
Ted
Place
,
director
of
Greater
Miami
Youth
for
Christ
,
and
Jon
Braun
,
director
of
Campus
Crusade
for
Christ
.
The
second
half
of
the
film
``
Communism
on
the
Map
''
and
the
movie
``
Operation
Abolition
''
also
will
be
shown
.
Response
to
the
program
has
been
so
encouraging
,
Kern
said
,
that
a
city-wide
youth
school
at
Dade
County
Auditorium
may
be
set
up
soon
.
And
to
encourage
other
churches
to
try
their
own
programs
,
Kern
said
this
Sunday's
sessions
--
including
the
free
dinner
--
will
be
open
to
anyone
who
makes
reservations
.
The
need
for
and
the
way
to
achieve
a
Christian
home
will
be
stressed
in
special
services
marking
National
Christian
Family
Week
in
Miami
area
churches
next
week
.
Of
particular
meaning
to
the
Charles
MacWhorter
family
,
3181
SW
24th
Ter.
,
will
be
the
Family
Dedication
Service
planned
for
10:50
a.m.
Sunday
at
First
Christian
Church
.
It
will
be
the
second
time
the
assistant
manager
of
a
Coral
Gables
restaurant
and
his
wife
have
taken
part
in
the
twice-a-year
ceremonies
for
families
with
new
babies
.
The
first
one
,
two
years
ago
,
changed
the
routine
of
their
home
life
.
``
When
you
stand
up
in
public
and
take
vows
to
strive
to
set
an
example
before
your
children
and
to
teach
them
the
fundamentals
of
the
Christian
faith
,
you
strive
a
little
harder
to
uphold
those
vows
''
,
explains
the
slender
vice
president
of
the
young
couples
Sunday
school
class
.
Until
that
first
dedication
service
,
he
and
Lois
felt
their
children
were
too
young
to
take
part
in
any
religious
life
at
home
.
They
have
five
daughters
--
Coral
Lee
,
5
,
Glenda
Rae
,
4
,
Pamela
,
3
,
Karen
,
2
,
and
Shari
,
five
months
.
But
after
that
service
,
they
decided
to
try
to
let
the
girls
say
grace
at
the
table
,
have
bedtime
prayers
,
and
Bible
stories
.
To
their
surprise
,
the
children
all
were
eager
and
quite
able
to
take
part
.
Even
the
two-year-old
feels
miffed
if
the
family
has
a
prayer-time
without
her
.
Dade's
chief
probation
officer
,
Jack
Blanton
,
will

10:45
a.m.
Sunday
service
marking

Every

The
Leningrad
Kirov
Ballet
,
which
opened
a
series
of
performances
Friday
night
at
the
Opera
House
,
is
,
I
think
,
the
finest
``
classical
''
ballet
company
I
have
ever
seen
,
and
the
production
of
the
Petipa-Tschaikowsky
``
Sleeping
Beauty
''
with
which
it
began
the
series
is
incomparably
the
finest
I
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
witnessing
.
This
work
is
no
favorite
of
mine
.
I
am
prepared
to
demonstrate
at
anytime
that
it
represents
the
spirit
of
Imperial
Russia
in
its
most
vulgar
,
infantile
,
and
reactionary
aspect
;
;
that
its
persistent
use
by
ballet
companies
of
the
Soviet
regime
indicates
that
that
old
spirit
is
just
as
stultifying
alive
today
as
it
ever
was
;
;
that
its
presentation
in
this
country
is
part
of
a
capitalist
plot
to
boobify
the
American
people
;
;
that
its
choreography
is
undistinguished
and
its
score
a
shapeless
assemblage
of
self-plagiarisms
.
All
of
this
is
true
and
all
of
it
is
totally
meaningless
in
the
face
of
the
Kirov's
utterly
captivating
presentation
.
Precise
The
reasons
for
this
enchantment
are
numerous
,
but
most
of
them

In
other
words
,
no
merely
male
creature
can
resist
that
corps
de
ballet
.
It
seems
to
have
been
chosen
exclusively
from
the
winners
of
beauty
contests
--
Miss
Omsk
,
Miss
Pinsk
,
Miss
Stalingr
oops
,
skip
it
.
These
qualities
alone
,
however
,
would
not
account
for
their
success
,
and
it
took
me
a
while
to
discover
the
crowning
virtue
that
completes
this
company's
collective
personality
.
It
is
a
kind
of
friendliness
and
frankness
of
address
toward
the
audience
which
we
have
been
led
to
believe
was
peculiar
to
the
American
ballet
.
Oh-the-pain-of-it
,
that
convention
of
Russian
ballet
whereby
the
girls
convey
the
idea
that
they
are
all
the
daughters
of
impoverished
Grand
Dukes
driven
to
the
stage
out
of
filial
piety
,
is
totally
absent
from
the
Kirov
.
This
is
all
the
more
remarkable
because
the
Kirov
is
to
ballet
what
Senator
Goldwater
is
to
American
politics
.
But
,
obviously
,
at
least
some
things
have
changed
for
the
better
in
Russia
so
far
as
the
ballet
is
concerned
.
Irina
Kolpakova
,
the
Princess
Aurora
of
Friday's
performance
,
would
be
a
change
for
the
better
anywhere
,
at
any
time
,
no
matter
who
had
had
the
role
before
.
She
is
the
most
beautiful
thing
you
ever
laid
eyes
on
,
and
her
dancing
has
a
feminine
suavity
,
lightness
,
sparkle
,
and
refinement
which
are
simply
incomparable
.
Hit
Alla
Sizova
,
who
seems
to
have
made
a
special
hit
in
the
East
,
was
delightful
as
the
lady
Bluebird
and
her
partner
,
Yuri
Soloviev
,
was
wonderfully
virile
,
acrobatic
,
and
poetic
all
at
the
same
time
,
in
a
tradition
not
unlike
that
of
Nijinsky
.
Vladilen
Semenov
,
a
fine
``
danseur
noble
''
;
;
Konstantin
Shatilov
,
a
great
character
dancer
;
;
and
Inna
Zubkovskaya
,
an
excellent
Lilac
Fairy
,
were
other
outstanding
members
of
the
cast
,
but
every
member
of
the
cast
was
magnificent
.
The
production
,
designed
by
Simon
Virsaladze
,
was
completely
traditional
but
traditional
in
the
right
way
.
It
was
done
with
great
taste
,
was
big
and
spacious
,
sumptuous
as
the
dreams
of
any
peasant
in
its
courtly
costumes
,
but
sumptuous
in
a
muted
,
pastel-like
style
,
with
rich
,
quiet
harmonies
of
color
between
the
costumes
themselves
and
between
the
costumes
and
the
scenery
.
Evegeni
Dubovskoi
conducted
an
exceptionally
large
orchestra
,
one
containing
excellent
soloists
--
the
violin
solos
by
the
concertmaster
,
Guy
Lumia
,
were
especially
fine
--
but
one
in
which
the
core
of
traveling
players
and
the
body
of
men
added
locally
had
not
had
time
to
achieve
much
unity
.

Famed
cellist
Pablo
Casals
took
his
instrument
to
the
East
Room
of
the
White
House
yesterday
and
charmed
the
staff
with
a
two-hour
rehearsal
.
He
was
getting
the
feel
of
the
room
for
a
concert
tomorrow
night
for
Puerto
Rico
Governor
Luis
Munoz
Marin
.
President
Kennedy's
invitation
to
the
Spanish-born
master
said
,
``
We
feel
your
performance
as
one
of
the
world's
greatest
artists
would
lend
distinction
to
the
entertainment
of
our
guests
''
.
For
A
good
many
seasons
I've
been
looking
at
the
naughty
stuff
on
television
,
so
the
other
night
I
thought
I
ought
to
see
how
immorality
is
doing
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
in
movies
.
After
all
,
this
year's
movies
are
next
year's
television
shows
.
So
I
went
to
see
``
La
Dolce
Vita
''
.
It
has
been
billed
as
a
towering
monument
to
immorality
.
All
the
sins
of
ancient
Rome
are
said
to
be
collected
into
this
three-hour
film
.
If
that's
all
the
Romans
did
,
it's
a
surprise
to
me
that
Rome
fell
.
After
television
,
``
La
Dolce
Vita
''
seems
as
harmless
as
a
Gray
Line
tour
of
North
Beach
at
night
.
I
cannot
imagine
a
single
scene
that
isn't
done
in
a
far
naughtier
manner
on
TV
every
week
.
I
believe
TV
watchers
will
be
bored
.
``
La
Dolce
Vita
''
has
none
of
the
senseless
brutality
or
sadism
of
the
average
TV
Western
.
Week
in
,
week
out
,
there
is
more
sex
to
be
seen
in
``
The
Adventures
Of
Ozzie
And
Harriet
''
.
There
is
more
decadence
on
``
77
Sunset
Strip
''
.
There
are
more
obvious
nymphomaniacs
on
any
private-eye
series
.
In
another
respect
,
television
viewers
will
feel
right
at
home
because
most
of
the
actors
are
unknowns
.
With
the
exception
of
Lex
Barker
and
Anita
Ekberg
,
the
credits
are
as
unfamiliar
as
you'll
find
on
the
Robert
Herridge
Theater
.
Most
of
the
emphasis
has
been
placed
on
a
``
wild
party
''
at
a
seaside
villa
.
Producer
Fellini
should
have
looked
at
some
of
the
old
silent
films
where
they
really
had
parties
!
!
The
Dolce
Vita
get-together
boasted
a
strip
tease
(
carried
as
far
as
a
black
slip
)
;
;
a
lady
drunk
on
her
hands
and
knees
who
carries
the
hero
around
on
her
back
while
he
throws
pillow
feathers
in
her
face
;
;
a
frigid
beauty
,
and
three
silly
fairies
.
Put
them
all
together
and
they
spell
out
the
only
four-letter
word
I
can
think
of
:
dull
.
Apparently
Fellini
caught
the
crowd
when
its
parties
had
begun
to
pall
.
What
a
swinging
group
they
must
have
been
when
they
first
started
entertaining
!
!
As
A
moral
shocker
it
is
a
dud
.
But
this
doesn't
detract
from
its
merit
as
an
interesting
,
if
not
great
,
film
.
The
Chronicle's
Paine
Knickerbocker
summed
it
up
neatly
:
``
This
is
a
long
picture
and
a
controversial
one
,
but
basically
it
is
a
moral
,
enthralling
and
heartbreaking
description
of
humans
who
have
become
unlinked
from
life
as
perhaps
Rome
has
from
her
traditional
political
,
cultural
and
religious
glories
''
.
And
when
they
sell
it
to
television
in
a
couple
of
years
,
it
can
be
shown
without
editing
.

,

according
to

from

.
And
you
think
you
have
language
problems
.
The
week
went
along
briskly
enough
.
I
bought
a
new
little
foreign
bomb
.
It
is
a
British
bomb
.
Very
austere
yet
racy
.
It
is
very
chic
to
drive
foreign
cars
.
With
a
foreign
car
you
must
wear
a
cap
--
it
has
a
leather
band
in
the
back
.
You
must
also
wear
a
car
coat
.
The
wardrobe
for
a
foreign
bomb
is
a
little
expensive
.
But
we
couldn't
really
get
along
without
it
.
``
Where
do
you
put
the
lighter
fluid
,
ha
,
ha
''
?
?
Asked
the
gas
station
man
.
The
present
crop
of
small
cars
is
enriching
American
humor
.
Gas
station
people
are
very
debonair
about
small
cars
.
When
I
drove
a
car
with
tail
fins
,
I
had
plenty
status
at
the
wind-and-water
oases
.
My
car
gulped
20
gallons
without
even
wiping
its
mouth
.
This
excellent
foreign
bomb
takes
only
six
.
When
I
had
my
big
job
with
the
double
headlights
and
yards
of
chrome
,
the
gas
people
were
happy
to
see
me
.
``
Tires
OK
?
?
Check
the
oil
and
water
,
sir
?
?
''
They
polished
the
windshield
.
They
had
a
loving
touch
.
The
man
stuck
the
nozzle
in
the
gas
tank
.
``
What
kind
of
car
is
it
''
?
?
He
asked
gloomily
.
``
It
is
a
British
Austin
,
the
smallest
they
make
''
.
``
Get
much
mileage
''
?
?
``
About
35
''
.
The
gas
station
man
sighed
unhappily
.
``
What
I
always
say
is
what
if
somebody
clobbers
you
in
a
little
car
like
that
?
?
Crunch
,
that's
all
she
wrote
''
.
``
I
will
die
rich
''
.
``
That
will
be
$1.80
''
,
said
the
gas
station
man
.
``
The
windshield
looks
pretty
clean
''
.
Ah
,
the
fair-weather
friends
of
yesteryear
!
!
When
I
wheeled
about
,
finned
fore
and
aft
,
I
was
the
darling
of
the
doormen
.
Dollar
bills
skidded
off
my
hands
and
they
tipped
their
caps
politely
.
With
a
small
bomb
,
I
tuck
it
between
Cadillacs
.
(
The
last
doorman
that
saw
me
do
that
should
calm
himself
.
High
blood
pressure
can
get
the
best
of
any
of
us

At
last
the
White
House
is
going
to
get
some
much-copied
furniture
by
that
master
American
craftsman
,
Duncan
Phyfe
,
whose
designs
were
snubbed
in
his
lifetime
when
the
U.
S.
Presidents
of
the
19th
Century
sent
abroad
for
their
furnishings
.
The
American
Institute
of
Decorators
has
acquired
a
rare
complete
set
of
sofas
and
chairs
which
are
to
be
placed
in
the
Executive
Mansion's
library
.
The
suite
has
been
in
the
same
family
since
the
early
1800's
.
The
gift
is
being
presented
by
``
heirs
and
descendants
of
the
Rutherford
family
of
New
Jersey
,
whose
famous
estate
,
``
Tranquility
''
,
was
located
near
the
Duncan
Phyfe
workshop
at
Andover
,
N.
J.
.
Authenticated
pieces
of
Duncan
Phyfe
furniture
are
uncommon
,
although
millions
of
American
homes
today
display
pieces
patterned
after
the
style
trends
he
set
150
years
ago
.
This
acquisition
is
a
matched
,
perfect
set
--
consisting
of
two
sofas
six
feet
long
,
plus
six
sidechairs
and
two
armchairs
.
The
AID
has
undertaken
the
redecoration
of
the
White
House
library
as
a
project
in
connection
with
the
work
being
done
by
First
Lady
Jacqueline
Kennedy's
Fine
Arts
Advisory
Committee
to
secure
antiques
for
the
presidential
home
.
It
is
the
AID's
intention
to
create
in
the
library
``
a
miniature
museum
of
Americana
''
before
completed
refurbishing
is
unveiled
early
this
fall
.
The
room
will
also
feature
another
rarity
many
antiquarians
would
consider
more
important
than
the
Duncan
Phyfe
furniture
.
The
AID
has
found
a
mantlepiece
attributed
to
Samuel
McIntyre
of
Salem
,
Mass.
,
an
architect
and
woodcarver
who
competed
for
the
designing
of
the
Capitol
here
in
1792
.
The
mantel
was
found
in
a
recently
demolished
Salem
house
and
is
being
fitted
over
the
White
House
library
fireplace
.
It
will
be
painted
to
match
the
paneling
in
the
room
.
The
AID
committee's
chairman
in
charge
of
the
redecoration
,
Mrs.
Henry
Francis
Lenygon
,
was
in
town
yesterday
to
consult
with
White
House
staff
members
on
the
project
.
Mrs.
Lenygon's
committee
associates
,
announced
formally
yesterday
by
the
AID
in
New
York
,
include
Mrs.
Allen
Lehman
McCluskey
and
Stephen
J.
Jussel
,
both
wellknown
Manhattan
decorators
.
Regional
representatives
appointed
to
serve
from
each
section
of
the
country
include
Frank
E.
Barnes
of
Boston
.
President
Kennedy
couldn't
stay
away
from
his
desk
for
the
75-minute
young
people's
concert
played
on
the
White
House
lawn
yesterday
by
the
85-piece
Transylvania
Symphony
Orchestra
from
Brevard
,
N.
C.
.
But
he
left
the
doors
to
his
office
open
so
he
could
hear
the
music
.
At
4
p.m.
the
President
left
the
White
House
to
welcome
the
young
musicians
,
students
from
the
ages
of
12
to
18
who
spend
six
weeks
at
the
Brevard
Music
Center
summer
camp
,
and
to
greet
the
325
crippled
,
cardiac
and
blind
children
from
the
District
area
who
were
special
guests
at
the
concert
.
It
was
the
first
in
the
series
of
``
Concerts
for
Young
People
by
Young
People
''
to
be
sponsored
by
First
Lady
Jacqueline
Kennedy
at
the
White
House
.
She
was
not
present
yesterday
,
however
,
to
enjoy
the
music
or
watch
the
faces
of
the
delighted
audience
.
She
is
vacationing
at
the
Kennedy
summer
home
in
Hyannis
Port
,
Mass.
,
and
in
his
welcoming
remarks
,
the
President
said
he
was
representing
her
.
As
he
approached
the
open
bandstand
,
erected
facing
the
South
entrance
to
the
Executive
Mansion
,
the
band
struck
up
the
``
Star
Spangled
Banner
''
and
followed
it
with
``
Hail
To
The
Chief
''
.
``
I
think
they
played
Hail
To
The
Chief
better
than
the
Marine
Corps
Band
,
and
we
are
grateful
to
them
''
,
President
Kennedy
remarked
after
mounting
the
bandstand
and
shaking
hands
with
conductor
James
Christian
Pfohl
.
After
paying
tribute
to
the
conductor
and
his
white-clad
youthful
students
,
President
Kennedy
said
,
``
As
an
American
I
have
the
greatest
possible
pride
in
the
work
that
is
being
done
in
dozens
of
schools
stretching
across
the
United
States
--
schools
where
devoted
teachers
are
studying
with
interested
young
men
and
women
and
opening
up
the
whole
wide
horizon
of
serious
music
''
.
He
added
``
I
think
that
sometimes
in
this
country
we
are
not
aware
as
we
should
be
of
the
extraordinary
work
that
is
being
done
in
this
field
''
.
Displaying
his
knowledge
of
music
,
the
New
England-born
President
remarked
that
``
probably
the
best
chamber
music
in
the
world
is
played
in
Vermont
,
by
young
Americans
--
and
here
in
this
school
where
they
have
produced
extraordinary
musicians
and
teachers
,
and
their
work
is
being
duplicated
all
across
the
United
States
.
``
This
is
a
great
national
cultural
asset
,
and
therefore
it
is
a
great
source
of
satisfaction
to
me
,
representing
as
I
do
today
my
wife
,
to
welcome
all
of
you
here
today
at
the
White
House
''
.
As
he
left
the
bandstand
to
return
to
his
office
,
the
slender
,
sun-tanned
Chief
Executive
paused
along
the
way
to
shake
hands
with
the
members
of
the
audience
in
wheel
chairs
forming
the
first
row
under
the
field
tent
set
up
for
the
guests
.
He
expressed
surprise
to
learn
that
pretty
,
blonde
Patricia
Holbrook
,
16
,
of
Mount
Rainier
,
had
attended
the
Joseph
P.
Kennedy
School
for
the
Handicapped
in
Boston
.
``
The
nuns
there
do
a
wonderful
work
''
,
the
President
commented
.
Patricia
now
attends
the
C.
Melvin
Sharpe
Health
School
in
the
District
.
Each
of
the
children
invited
to
the
concert
wore
a
name
tag
marked
with
a
red
,
white
and
blue
ribbon
.
They
enjoyed
lemonade
and
cookies
served
before
and
during
the
concert
by
teenage
sons
and
daughters
of
members
of
the
White
House
staff
.
Many
of
the
music-loving
members
of
the
President's
staff
gathered
around
the
tent
listening
and
watching
the
rapt
attention
given
by
the
young
seated
audience
.
And
it
turned
out
to
be
more
of
a
family
affair
than
expected
.
Henry

at

camp
25
years
ago
and
now
on
the
President's
staff
as
liaison
representative
with
the
House
of

,

Transylvania
Symphony
Conductor
Pfohl
said
yesterday
that
Mrs.
Kennedy's
Social
Secretary
,
Letitia
Baldrige
,
told
about
plans
for
White
House
youth
concerts
before
the
National
Symphony
Orchestra
League
in
Philadelphia
last
spring
.
He
said
he
contacted
a
friend
,
Henry
Hall
Wilson
,
on
the
President's
staff
and
asked
whether
his
orchestra
could
play
,
in
the
series
.
A
flow
of
correspondence
between
Pfohl
and
Miss
Baldrige
resulted
in
an
invitation
to
the
85-student
North
Carolina
group
to
play
the
first
concert
.
One
of
the
most
interested
``
students
''
on
the
tour
which
the
Brevard
group
took
at
the
National
Gallery
yesterday
following
their
concert
at
the
White
House
,
was
Letitia
Baldrige
,
social
secretary
to
First
Lady
Jacqueline
Kennedy
.
``
I
was
an
art
major
in
college
''
,
Miss
Baldrige
explained
.
``
I've
been
here
so
many
times
I
couldn't
count
them
''
.
She
turned
out
to
be
a
fan
,
too
,
of
Margaret
Bouton
,
the
Gallery's
associate
curator
of
education
.
Miss
Bouton
headed
up
one
of
the
four
groups
that
went
on
simultaneous
tours
after
the
Gallery
had
closed
at
5
p.m.
.
The
Brevard
group
of
85
arrived
at
the
Gallery
at
6
p.m.
,
remaining
for
about
45
minutes
.
The
Brevard
visitors
had
very
little
to
say
at
the
beginning
of
the
tour
but
warmed
up
later
.
They
decided
that
they
thought
Rembrandt's
self-portrait
made
him
look
``
sad
''
;
;
they
noticed
Roman
buildings
in
the
background
of
Raphael's
``
Alba
Madonna
''
and
``
texture
''
in
a
Monet
painting
of
Rheims
Cathedral
.
Everybody
had
heard
of
Van
Gogh
,
the
French
impressionist
.
Gallery
Director
John
Walker
greeted
the
group
,
standing
on
one
of
the
benches
in
the
downstairs
lobby
to
speak
to
them
.
He
pointed
out
to
the
young
musicians
that
the
National
Gallery
``
is
the
only
museum
in
the
country
to
have
a
full-time
music
director
,
Richard
Bales
.
I'm
sure
you've
heard
of
him
and
his
record
,
'
The
Confederacy
'
''
.
Along
with
the
gallery
aide
who
explained
the
various
paintings
and
sculptures
to
each
group
,
went
one
of
the
Gallery's
blue-uniformed
guards
.
In
45
minutes
,
the
Gallery
leaders
had
given
the
students
a
quick
rundown
on
art
from
the
Renaissance
to
the
late
19th
Century
.
A
few
of
them
said
they
``
preferred
contemporary
art
''
.
Among
the
other
artists
,
whose
paintings
were
discussed
were
Boucher
,
Courbet
,
Fra
Angelico
.
The
thing
that
impressed
one
of
the
visitors
the
most
was
the
Gallery's
rotunda
fountain
``
because
it's
on
the
second
floor
''
.
That
imposing
,
somewhat
austere
,
and
seemingly
remote
collonaded
building
with
the
sphynxes
perched
on
its
threshold
at
1733
16th
St.
nw.
took
on
bustling
life
yesterday
.
More
than
250
Scottish
Rite
Masons
and
guests
gathered
in
their
House
of
the
Temple
to
pay
tribute
to
their
most
prominent
leader
,
Albert
Pike
,
who
headed
the
Scottish
Rite
from
1859
to
1891
.
They
came
together
in
the
huge
,
high-ceilinged
Council
Chamber
to
hear
the
late
leader
eulogized
.
C.
Wheeler
Barnes
of
Denver
,
head
of
the
Scottish
Rite
in
Colorado
,
praised
Pike
as
a
historian
,
author
,
poet
,
journalist
,
lawyer
,
jurist
,
soldier
and
musician
,
who
devoted
most
of
his
mature
years
to
the
strengthening
of
the
Masonic
Order
.
The
ceremony
ended
with
the
laying
of
a
wreath
at
the
crypt
of
Pike
in
the
House
of
the
Temple
.
A
reception
and
tea
followed
.
About
1500
delegates
are
expected
to
register
today
for
the
biennial
session
of
the
Ancient
and
Accepted
Scottish
Rite
for
the
Southern
Jurisdiction
of
the
United
States
.
The
opening
session
of
the
5-day
session
will
begin
at
10
a.m.
today
.
There
will
be
a
pilgrimage
to
Mount
Vernon
at
2:30
p.m.
.
A
wreath
will
be
placed
at
the
tomb
of
George
Washington
,
one
of
this
Nation's
first
Masons
--
a
past
master
of
Washington-Alexandria
Lodge
22
in
Alexandria
.
The
marriage
of
John
and
Mary
Black
had
clearly
reached
the
breaking
point
after
eight
years
.
John
had
a
job
in
a
small
firm
where
the
work
was
dull
and
monotonous
.
He
would
come
home
in
the
evening
tired
and
discouraged
--
in
no
frame
of
mind
to
play
with
their
three
children
,
or
spend
much
time
chatting
with
his
wife
.
Hurt
by
his
lack
of
interest
and
attention
,
Mary
complained
often
that
he
didn't
help
around
the
house
,
and
that
he
didn't
really
care
about
the
family
.
She
accused
him
of
ignoring
her
.
He
in
turn
told
her
she
demanded
too
much
.
They
were
both
discouraged
,
disgusted
and
miserable
.
Mary
decided
she
had
had
enough
.
Without
any
definite
plan
in
mind
,
she
went
to
a
judge
to
see
what
could
be
done
.
The
judge
listened
quietly
as
the
young
woman
poured
out
her
frustrations
--
then
discussing
with
her
the
possibility
of
seeking
aid
from
Family
Service
before
going
to
a
lawyer
.
Family
Service
,
sharing
in
UGF
,
has
five
agencies
in
the
Washington
area
.
They
offer
to
the
people
of
this
community
case
work
service
and
counseling
on
a
wide
variety
of
family
problems
.
Because
neither
of
them
really
wanted
their
marriage
to
break
up
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Black
agreed
to
a
series
of
interviews
at
Family
Service
of
Northern
Virginia
,
the
agency
nearest
them
.
For
nearly
a
year
,
they
have
been
receiving
counseling
,
separately
and
together
,
in
an
effort
to
understand
and
overcome
the
antagonisms
which
had
given
rise
to
the
possibility
of
divorce
.
The
interviews
have
led
each
of
them
to
a
new
appreciation
of
the
problems
confronting
the
other
.
They
are
now
working
together
toward
solving
their
difficulties
.
John
received
a
promotion
in
his
firm
.
He
gives
credit
for
the
promotion
to
his
new
outlook
on
life
.
Mary
is
cheery
and
gay
when
her
husband
comes
home
in
the
evenings
,
and
the
children's
bed-time
is
frequently
preceeded
by
a
session
of
happy
,
family
rough-housing
.
To
outsiders
,
the
Blacks
seem
to
be
an
ordinary
,
happy
family
,
and
they
are
--
but
with
a
difference
.
They
know
the
value
of
being
just
that
--
an
ordinary
,
happy
family
.
Family
Service
has
helped
hundreds
of
families
in
this
area
.
Perhaps
to
some
their
work
does
not
seem
particularly
vital
.
But
to
the
families
it
serves
,
their
help
cannot
be
measured
.
Family
Service
could
not
open
its
doors
to
a
single
family
without
the
financial
support
of
the
United
Givers
Fund
.
Anticipated
heavy
traffic

the
Skyline
Drive

to
materialize

park

,
and
those
who
made
the
trip
got
a
leisurely
view
of

of
haze
.
For
crucial
encounter
One
of
the
initial
questions
put
to
President
Kennedy
at
his
first
news
conference
last
January
was
about
his
attitude
toward
a
meeting
with
Premier
Khrushchev
.
Mr.
Kennedy
replied
:
``
I'm
hopeful
that
from
more
traditional
exchanges
we
can
perhaps
find
greater
common
ground
''
.
The
President
knew
that
a
confrontation
with
Mr.
Khrushchev
sooner
or
later
probably
was
inevitable
and
even
desirable
.
But
he
was
convinced
that
the
realities
of
power
--
military
,
economic
and
ideological
--
were
the
decisive
factors
in
the
struggle
with
the
Communists
and
that
these
could
not
be
talked
away
at
a
heads
of
government
meeting
.
He
wanted
to
buy
time
to
strengthen
the
U.
S.
and
its
allies
and
to
define
and
begin
to
implement
his
foreign
policy
.
Last
Friday
the
White
House
announced
:
President
Kennedy
will
meet
with
Soviet
Premier
Nikita
S.
Khrushchev
in
Vienna
June
3
and
4
.
The
announcement
came
after
a
period
of
sharp
deterioration
in
East-West
relations
.
The
heightened
tension
,
in
fact
,
had
been
a
major
factor
in
the
President's
change
of
view
about
the
urgency
of
a
meeting
with
the
Soviet
leader
.
He
was
not
going
to
Vienna
to
negotiate
--
the
simultaneous
announcements
in
Washington
and
Moscow
last
week
stressed
that
no
formal
negotiations
were
planned
.
But
Mr.
Kennedy
had
become
convinced
that
a
personal
confrontation
with
Mr.
Khrushchev
might
be
the
only
way
to
prevent
catastrophe
.
That
objective
set
the
high
stakes
and
drama
of
the
Vienna
meeting
.
Despite
efforts
by
Washington
last
week
to
play
down
the
significance
of
the
meeting
,
it
clearly
was
going
to
be
one
of
the
crucial
encounters
of
the
cold
war
.
Road
to
Vienna
The
U.
S.
and
Soviet
heads
of
Government
have
met
three
times
since
Sir
Winston
Churchill
in
1953
introduced
a
new
word
into
international
diplomacy
with
his
call
for
a
fresh
approach
to
the
problem
of
peace
``
at
the
summit
of
the
nations
''
.
The
first
time
was
in
1955
when
a
full-dress
Big
Four
summit
meeting
produced
the
``
spirit
of
Geneva
''
.
The
spirit
served
chiefly
to
lull
the
West
while
Moscow
made
inroads
into
the
Middle
East
.
In
1959
President
Eisenhower
and
Premier
Khrushchev
held
an
informal
session
in
the
U.
S.
.
That
meeting
produced
the
``
spirit
of
Camp
David
''
--
a
spirit
,
it
later
turned
out
,
that
masked
a
basic
misunderstanding
about
progress
toward
a
Berlin
settlement
.
On
the
third
occasion
--
another
Big
Four
summit
session
at
Paris
a
year
ago
--
there
was
no
problem
of
an
illusory
``
spirit
''
.
Premier
Khrushchev
wrecked
the
conference
at
its
initial
session
with
a
bitter
denunciation
of
the
U.
S.
for
the
U-2
incident
.
The
episode
tended
to
confirm
the
U.
S.
belief
that
propaganda
,
the
hope
of
one-sided
concessions
,
and
the
chance
to
split
the
Allies
,
rather
than
genuine
negotiation
,
were
the
Soviet
leader's
real
aims
in
summitry
.
Pre-inaugural
position
Thus
when
Premier
Khrushchev
intimated
even
before
inauguration
that
he
hoped
for
an
early
meeting
with
the
new
President
,
Mr.
Kennedy
was
confronted
with
a
delicate
problem
.
Shortly
before
his
nomination
he
had
set
forth
his
basic
view
about
the
problem
of
negotiations
with
the
Soviet
leader
in
these
words
:
``
As
long
as
Mr.
Khrushchev
is
convinced
that
the
balance
of
world
power
is
shifting
his
way
,
no
amount
of
either
smiles
or
toughness
,
neither
Camp
David
talks
nor
kitchen
debates
,
can
compel
him
to
enter
fruitful
negotiations
''
.
The
President
had
set
for
himself
the
task
,
which
he
believed
vital
,
of
awakening
the
U.
S.
and
its
allies
to
the
hard
and
complex
effort
necessary
to
shift
that
balance
.
He
did
not
want
the
effort
weakened
by
any
illusion
that
summit
magic
might
make
it
unnecessary
.
He
wanted
time
,
too
,
to
review
the
United
States'
global
commitments
and
to
test
both
the
policies
he
had
inherited
and
new
ones
he
was
formulating
.
Above
all
,
he
did
not
want
to
appear
to
be
running
hat
in
hand
to
Premier
Khrushchev's
doorstep
.
Attitude
flexible
At
the
same
time
the
President
took
pains
not
to
rule
out
an
eventual
meeting
with
the
Soviet
leader
.
Ideally
,
he
knew
,
it
should
be
preceded
by
concrete
progress
at
lower
levels
.
But
Mr.
Kennedy
saw
value
even
in
an
informal
meeting
,
provided
that
undue
hopes
were
not
raised
in
connection
with
it
.
It
would
give
him
an
opportunity
to
take
the
measure
of
his
chief
adversary
in
the
cold
war
,
to
try
to
probe
Mr.
Khrushchev's
intentions
and
to
make
clear
his
own
views
.
Moreover
,
an
eventual
meeting
was
desirable
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
satisfy
world
opinion
that
the
U.
S.
was
not
inflexible
and
was
sparing
no
effort
to
ease
international
tensions
.
Both
elements
--
the
caution
about
a
meeting
,
the
willingness
eventually
to
hold
one
--
were
reflected
in
a
letter
from
the
President
which
Ambassador
Llewellyn
E.
Thompson
brought
back
to
Russia
late
in
February
.
The
letter
,
dated
Feb.
22
,
was
delivered
to
Premier
Khrushchev
in
Novosibirsk
,
Siberia
,
on
March
9
.
It
dealt
mainly
with
a
broad
range
of
East-West
issues
.
But
it
also
briefly
suggested
the
possibility
of
a
meeting
with
Mr.
Khrushchev
before
the
end
of
the
year
if
the
international
climate
were
favorable
and
schedules
permitted
.
Developments
over
the
next
two
months
,
however
,
caused
the
President
to
reconsider
the
question
of
the
timing
.
There
were
intense
discussions
in
the
inner
councils
of
the
White
House
about
the
advisability
of
an
early
meeting
,
not
because
the
international
climate
was
improving
,
but
precisely
because
it
was
deteriorating
alarmingly
.
Deadlock
on
tests
The
President
was
especially
concerned
about
the
deadlock
in
the
nuclear
test
ban
negotiations
at
Geneva
.
The
deadlock
has
been
caused
by
the
Russians'
new
demand
for
a
three-man
(
East
,
West
and
neutral
)
directorate
,
and
thus
a
veto
,
over
the
control
machinery
.
In
the
U.
S.
,
strong
pressures
have
been
building
up
for
a
resumption
of
tests
on
grounds
that
the
Russians
may
be
secretly
testing
.
Mr.
Kennedy
was
less
troubled
by
that
possibility
than
by
the
belief
that
a
Geneva
breakdown
,
or
even
continued
stalemate
,
would
mean
an
unchecked
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
to
other
countries
as
well
as
a
fatal
blow
to
any
hope
for
disarmament
.
There
was
reason
to
believe
that
Premier
Khrushchev
was
also
concerned
about
a
possible
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
,
particularly
to
Communist
China
.
The
question
arose
as
to
whether
a
frank
discussion
of
that
danger
with
the
Soviet
leader
had
not
become
urgent
.
Moreover
,
Moscow
appeared
determined
to
apply
the
tripartite
veto
principle
to
the
executive
organs
of
all
international
bodies
,
including
the
U.
N.
Secretariat
and
the
International
Control
Commission
for
Laos
.
Mr.
Kennedy
was
convinced
that
insistence
on
the
demand
would
make
international
agreements
,
or
even
negotiations
,
impossible
.
Developments
in
Cuba
and
Laos
also
suggested
the
advisability
of
an
early
summit
meeting
.
Initially
the
White
House
reaction
was
that
the
bitter
exchanges
with
Moscow
over
Cuba
and
the
conflict
in
Laos
had
dampened
prospects
for
a
meeting
.
At
the
same
time
,
there
was
increased
reason
for
a
quick
meeting
lest
the
Soviet
leader
,
as
a
result
of
those
episodes
,
come
to
a
dangerously
erroneous
conclusion
about
the
West's
ability
and
determination
to
resist
Communist
pressure
.
In
Cuba
,
the
U.
S.
had
blundered
badly
and
created
the
impression
of
impotency
against
Communist
penetration
even
on
its
own
doorstep
.
In
Laos
,
the
picture
was
almost
equally
bad
.
U.
S.
willingness
to
accept
a
neutral
Laos
may
have
led
Premier
Khrushchev
to
believe
that
other
areas
could
be
``
neutralized
''
on
Soviet
terms
.
Beyond
that
,
Allied
disagreement
about
military
intervention
in
Laos
--
despite
warnings
that
they
might
do
so
--
allowed
Moscow
to
carry
out
with
impunity
a
series
of
military
and
diplomatic
moves
that
greatly
strengthened
the
pro-Communist
forces
.
As
a
result
,
the
West
is
in
a
poor
bargaining
position
at
the
current
Geneva
negotiations
on
Laos
,
and
South
Vietnam
and
other
nations
in
Southeast
Asia
are
under
increased
pressure
.
In
the
light
of
those
events
,
there
appeared
to
be
a
real
danger
that
Premier
Khrushchev
might
overreach
himself
.
Ambassador
Thompson
reported
from
Moscow
that
the
Soviet
leader's
mood
was
cocky
and
aggressive
.
He
has
indicated
that
he
plans
new
moves
on
Berlin
before
the
year
is
out
.
The
President
and
his
advisers
felt
that
the
time
might
have
come
to
warn
Premier
Khrushchev
against
a
grave
miscalculation
in
areas
such
as
Berlin
,
Iran
or
Latin
America
from
which
there
would
be
no
turning
back
.
It
was
in
the
midst
of
such
White
House
deliberations
that
Premier
Khrushchev
on
May
4
made
new
inquiries
through
the
U.
S.
Embassy
in
Moscow
about
a
meeting
with
the
President
in
the
near
future
.
Mr.
Kennedy
told
Moscow
he
would
give
his
answer
by
May
20
after
consultation
with
the
Allies
.
The
response
from
London
,
Paris
and
Bonn
was
favorable
.
Firm
arrangements
for
the
meeting
in
Vienna
were
worked
out
in
a
final
exchange
between
Moscow
and
Washington
last
week
.
Apparently
at
the
insistence
of
the
U.
S.
,
the
simultaneous
announcements
issued
in
Washington
and
Moscow
last
Friday
emphasized
the
``
informal
''
nature
of
the
meeting
.
The
Washington
announcement
said
:
``
The
President
and
Chairman
Khrushchev
understand
that
this
meeting
is
not
for
the
purpose
of
negotiating
or
reaching
agreement
on
the
major
international
problems
that
involve
the
interest
of
many
other
countries
.
The
meeting
will
,
however
,
afford
a
timely
and
convenient
opportunity
for
the
first
personal
contact
between
them
and
a
general
exchange
of
views
on
the
major
issues
which
affect
the
relationships
between
the
two
countries
''
.
The
outlook
The
Vienna
meeting
will
bring
together
a
seasoned
,
67-year-old
veteran
of
the
cold
war
who
,
in
Mr.
Kennedy's
own
words
,
is
``
shrewd
,
tough
,
vigorous
,
well-informed
and
confident
''
,
and
a
44-year-old
President
(
his
birthday
is
May
29
)
with
a
demonstrated
capacity
for
political
battle
but
little
experience
in
international
diplomacy
.
The
announcement
last
week
of
the
forthcoming
encounter
produced
strong
reactions
in
the
U.
S.
of
both
approval
and
disapproval
.
The
approval
did
not
arise
from
an
expectation
of
far-reaching
agreements
at
Vienna
.
The
inclination
was
to
accept
the
statement
that
there
would
be
no
formal
negotiations
.
But
those
who
were
in
favor
of
the
meeting
felt
that
a
frank
exchange
between
the
two
men
and
an
opportunity
to
size
one
another
up
would
prove
salutary
.
Mr.
Khrushchev
is
known
to
rely
heavily
on
his
instincts
about
his
adversaries
and
to
be
a
shrewd
judge
of
men
.
The
feeling
was
that
he
would
sense
an
inner
core
of
toughness
and
determination
in
the
President
and
that
plain
talk
by
Mr.
Kennedy
would
give
him
pause
.
Apart
from
the
personal
equation
,
another
reason
advanced
in
favor
of
the
meeting
was
that
too
often
in
the
past
the
U.S.
appeared
to
have
been
dragged
reluctantly
to
the
summit
.
Premier
Khrushchev
has
made
propaganda
capital
out
of
that
fact
and
in
the
end
got
his
summit
meeting
anyway
.
This
time
the
initiative
came
,
in
part
at
least
,
from
Washington
.
Other
allies
consulted
There
was
also
the
fact
that
by
the
time
he
meets
Mr.
Khrushchev
,
the
President
will
have
completed
conversations
with
all
the
other
principal
Allied
leaders
.
Thus
he
will
be
in
a
position
to
disabuse
the
Soviet
leader
of
any
notions
he
may
have
about
grave
Allied
disunity
.
Finally
,
there
was
a
wide
area
of
agreement
on
the
value
of
the
President's
making
a
final
effort
in
the
summit
spotlight
for
a
nuclear
test
accord
.
There
is
no
single
issue
that
has
aroused
stronger
feelings
throughout
the
world
.
If
tests
are
to
be
resumed
,
the
argument
went
,
it
is
vital
that
the
U.
S.
make
plain
that
the
onus
belongs
to
the
Soviet
Union
.
Disapproval
of
the
meeting
was
based
largely
on
the
belief
that
the
timing
could
hardly
be
worse
.
After
Cuba
and
Laos
,
it
was
argued
,
Mr.
Khrushchev
will
interpret
the
President's
consent
to
the
meeting
as
further
evidence
of
Western
weakness
--
perhaps
even
panic
--
and
is
certain
to
try
to
exploit
the
advantage
he
now
believes
he
holds
.
Moreover
,
the
President
is
meeting
the
Soviet
leader
at
a
time
when
the
Administration
has
still
not
decided
on
the
scope
of
America's
firm
foreign
policy
commitments
.
The
question
was
raised
,
for
example
,
as
to
what
attitude
the
President
would
take
if
Mr.
Khrushchev
proposes
a
broad
neutral
belt
extending
from
Southeast
Asia
to
the
Middle
East
.
There
are
,
so
my
biologist
friends
tell
me
,
mechanisms
of
adaptation
and
defense
that
are
just
too
complete
and
too
satisfactory
.
Mollusks
are
a
case
in
point
.
The
shell
,
which
served
the
strain
so
well
at
a
relatively
early
stage
in
the
evolutionary
scheme
,
tended
to
cancel
out
the
possibility
of
future
development
.
Though
this
may
or
may
not
be
good
biology
,
it
does
aptly
illustrate
the
strength
and
the
weakness
of
American
Catholic
higher
education
.
There
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
American
Catholic
accomplishment
in
the
field
of
higher
education
is
most
impressive
:
our
European
brethren
never
cease
to
marvel
at
the
number
and
the
size
of
our
colleges
and
universities
.
The
deeper
wonder
is
how
this
miracle
was
accomplished
in
decades
,
rather
than
in
centuries
and
by
immigrant
minorities
at
that
.
By
way
of
explanation
we
ourselves
are
prone
to
imagine
that
this
achievement
stems
from
the
same
American
Catholic
zeal
and
generosity
which
brought
the
parochial
school
system
into
existence
.
There
is
,
however
,
one
curious
discrepancy
in
this
broad
and
flattering
picture
.
Viewing
the
American
Catholic
educational
achievement
in
retrospect
,
we
may
indeed
see
it
as
a
unified
whole
extending
from
grade
school
to
university
.
But
the
simple
truth
is
that
higher
education
has
never
really
been
an
official
American
Catholic
project
;
;
certainly
not
in
the
same
sense
that
the
establishment
of
a
parochial
school
system
has
been
a
matter
of
official
policy
.
Official
encouragement
is
one
thing
,
but
the
down-to-earth
test
is
the
allocation
of
diocesan
and
parochial
funds
.
American
Catholics
have
responded
generously
to
bishops'
and
pastors'
appeals
for
the
support
necessary
to
create
parochial
schools
but
they
have
not
contributed
in
a
similar
fashion
to
the
establishment
of
institutions
of
higher
learning
.
They
have
not
done
so
for
the
simple
reason
that
such
appeals
have
hardly
ever
been
made
.
Diocesan
authorities
generally
have
not
regarded
this
as
their
direct
responsibility
.
All
of
this
may
be
understandable
enough
:
it
is
,
however
,
in
fact
difficult
to
see
how
diocesan
authorities
could
have
acted
otherwise
.
Yet
for
better
or
for
worse
,
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
most
American
Catholic
colleges
do
not
owe
their
existence
to
general
Catholic
support
but
rather
to
the
initiative
,
resourcefulness
and
sacrifices
of
individual
religious
communities
.
Community
esprit
de
corps
has
been
the
protective
shell
which
has
made
the
achievement
possible
.
To
understand
the
past
history
--
and
the
future
potential
--
of
American
Catholic
higher
education
,
it
is
necessary
to
appreciate
the
special
character
of
the
esprit
de
corps
of
the
religious
community
.
It
is
something
more
than
the
arithmetical
sum
of
individual
totals
of
piety
and
detachment
.
A
religious
community
with
a
vital
sense
of
mission
achieves
a
degree
of
group
orientation
and
group
identification
seldom
found
elsewhere
.
The
fact
that
the
group
orientation
and
group
identification
are
founded
on
supernatural
principles
and
nourished
by
the
well-springs
of
devotion
simply
give
them
a
deeper
and
more
satisfying
dimension
.
The
net
result
is
a
uniquely
satisfying
sense
of
comradeship
,
the
kind
of
comradeship
which
sparks
enthusiasm
and
blunts
the
cutting
edge
of
sacrifice
and
hardship
.
American
Catholic
colleges
and
universities
are
,
in
a
very
real
sense
,
the
product
of
``
private
enterprise
''
--
the
``
private
enterprise
''
of
religious
communities
.
Had
it
not
been
for
such
private
enterprise
,
diocesan
authorities
might
of
course
have
been
goaded
into
establishing
institutions
subsidized
by
diocesan
funds
and
parish
collections
and
staffed
by
religious
as
paid
employees
.
There
is
however
no
point
in
speculating
about
such
a
possibility
:
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
our
institutions
of
higher
learning
owe
their
existence
to
a
spirit
not
unlike
that
which
produces
the
``
family
business
''
.
This
``
family-community
''
spirit
is
the
real
explanation
of
the
marvel
of
our
achievement
.
It
is
this
spirit
which
explains
some
of
the
anomalies
of
American
Catholic
higher
education
,
in
particular
the
wasteful
duplication
apparent
in
some
areas
.
I
think
for
example
of
three
women's
colleges
with
pitifully
small
enrollments
,
clustered
within
a
few
miles
of
a
major
Catholic
university
,
which
is
also
co-educational
.
This
is
not
an
isolated
example
;
;
this
aspect
of
the
total
picture
has
been
commented
upon
often
enough
.
It
would
seem
to
represent
esprit
de
corps
run
riot
.
Apart
,
however
,
from
the
question
of
wasteful
duplication
,
there
is
another
aspect
of
the
``
family
business
''
spirit
in
American
Catholic
higher
education
which
deserves
closer
scrutiny
.
For
while
the
past
needs
of
the
Church
in
this
country
may
have
been
adequately
met
by
collegiate
institutions
,
which
in
temper
and
tone
closely
resembled
junior
colleges
and
finishing
schools
,
it
would
seem
that
today's
need
is
for
the
college
which
more
closely
resembles
the
university
in
its
``
pursuit
of
excellence
''
.
At
the
earlier
``
pre-academic
excellence
''
stage
of
Catholic
education
,
the
operation
could
be
conducted
on
an
intra-mural
community
basis
.
But
with
today's
demand
for
professional
qualifications
and
specialized
training
,
the
need
for
``
outsiders
''
becomes
more
pressing
.
The
problem
is
not
merely
that
more
``
outside
teachers
''
are
needed
but
that
a
different
brand
is
called
for
.
Commenting
on
the
earlier
stage
,
the
Notre
Dame
Chapter
of
the
American
Association
of
University
Professors
(
in
a
recent
report
on
the
question
of
faculty
participation
in
administrative
decision-making
)
noted
that
the
term
``
teacher-employee
''
(
as
opposed
to
,
e.g.
,
``
maintenance
employee
''
)
was
a
not
inapt
description
.
Today
however
,
the
``
outsider
''
is
likely
to
have
professional
qualifications
of
the
highest
order
(
otherwise
the
college
would
not
be
interested
in
hiring
him
)
and
to
be
acclimatized
to
the
democratic
processes
of
the
secular
or
state
university
.
And
while
no
one
expects
total
democracy
on
the
academic
scene
,
the
scholar
will
be
particularly
sensitive
to
a
line
between
first
and
second
class
citizenship
drawn
on
any
basis
other
than
that
of
academic
rank
or
professional
achievement
.
In
the
above
mentioned
report
of
the
Notre
Dame
Chapter
of
the
American
Association
of
University
Professors
,
the
basic
outlook
of
the
new
breed
of
lay
faculty
emerges
very
clearly
in
the
very
statement
of
the
problem
as
the
members
see
it
:
``
Even
with
the
best
of
intentions
he
(
the
President
of
the
university
)
is
loath
to
delegate
such
authority
and
responsibility
to
a
group
the
membership
of
which
,
considered
(
as
it
must
be
by
him
)
in
individual
terms
,
is
inhomogeneous
,
mortal
and
of
extremely
varying
temperament
,
interests
and
capabilities
.
It
is
natural
that
he
should
turn
for
his
major
support
to
a
select
and
dedicated
few
from
the
organization
which
actually
owns
the
university
and
whose
goals
are
,
in
their
opinion
,
identified
with
its
highest
good
and
(
to
use
that
oft-repeated
phrase
)
'
the
attainment
of
excellence
'
''
.
The
pattern
here
pictured
is
clearly
not
peculiar
to
Notre
Dame
:
it
is
simply
that
the
paradox
involved
in
this
kind
of
control
of
the
institution
by
``
the
organization
which
actually
owns
''
it
,
becomes
more
obvious
where
there
is
a
larger
and
more
distinguished
``
outside
''
faculty
.
It
is
particularly
interesting
that
those
who
framed
the
report
should
refer
to
``
the
organization
which
actually
owns
the
university
''
:
this
seems
to
show
an
awareness
of
the
fact
that
there
is
more
to
the
problem
than
the
ordinary
issue
of
clerical-lay
tension
.
But
in
any
case
,
one
does
not
have
to
read
very
closely
between
the
lines
to
realize
that
the
situation
is
not
regarded
as
a
particularly
happy
one
.
``
Outside
''
faculty
members
want
to
be
considered
partners
in
the
academic
enterprise
and
not
merely
paid
employees
of
a
family
business
.
There
are
two
reasons
why
failure
to
come
to
grips
with
this
demand
could
be
fatal
to
the
future
of
the
Catholic
university
.
In
the
first
place
there
is
the
obvious
problem
of
recruiting
high
caliber
personnel
.
Word
spreads
rapidly
in
the
tightly
knit
academic
profession
,
much
given
to
attending
meetings
and
conferences
.
Expressions
of
even
low-key
dissatisfaction
by
a
Catholic
college
faculty
member
has
the
effect
of
confirming
the
already
existing
stereotype
.
In
the
academic
world
there
is
seldom
anything
so
dramatic
as
a
strike
or
a
boycott
:
all
that
happens
is
that
the
better
qualified
teacher
declines
to
gamble
two
or
three
years
of
his
life
on
the
chance
that
conditions
at
the
Catholic
institution
will
be
as
good
as
those
elsewhere
.
To
appreciate
the
nature
of
the
gamble
,
it
should
be
realized
that
while
college
teaching
is
almost
a
public
symbol
of
security
,
that
security
does
not
come
as
quickly
or
as
automatically
as
it
does
in
an
elementary
school
system
or
in
the
Civil
Service
.
Much
has
been
made
of
the
fact
that
major
Catholic
institutions
now
guarantee
firm
tenure
.
This
is
a
significant
advance
but
its
import
should
not
be
exaggerated
.
When
a
man
invests
a
block
of
his
years
at
a
university
without
gaining
the
coveted
promotion
,
not
only
is
he
faced
with
the
problem
of
starting
over
but
there
is
also
a
certain
depreciation
in
the
market
value
of
his
services
.
A
man
does
not
make
that
kind
of
gamble
if
he
suspects
that
one
or
more
of
the
limited
number
of
tenure
positions
is
being
reserved
for
members
of
the
``
family
''
.
Just
as
it
is
possible
to
exaggerate
the
drawing
power
of
the
new
tenure
practices
,
it
is
also
possible
to
exaggerate
the
significance
of
the
now
relatively
adequate
salaries
paid
by
major
Catholic
institutions
.
Adequate
compensation
is
indispensable
.
Yet
adequate
compensation
--
and
particularly
merely
adequate
compensation
is
no
substitute
for
those
intangibles
which
cause
a
man
to
sacrifice
part
of
his
earning
potential
by
taking
up
college
teaching
in
the
first
place
.
Broadly
speaking
the
total
Catholic
atmosphere
is
such
an
intangible
but
the
larger
demand
is
for
a
sense
of
creative
participation
and
mature
responsibility
in
the
total
work
of
the
university
.
Religious
who
derive
their
own
sense
of
purpose
through
identification
with
the
religious
community
rather
than
the
academic
community
are
prone
to
underestimate
both
the
layman's
reservoir
of
idealism
and
his
need
for
this
identification
.
There
is
no
need
here
to
spell
out
the
conditions
of
creative
teaching
except
to
point
out
that
,
at
the
college
level
,
the
sense
of
community
and
of
community
responsibility
is
even
more
necessary
than
it
is
at
other
levels
.
The
college
teacher
needs
the
stimulus
of
communication
with
other
faculty
members
but
he
also
needs
to
feel
that
such
communication
,
even
informal
debates
over
the
luncheon
table
,
are
a
contribution
to
the
total
good
of
the
institution
.
But
this
in
turn
means
that
decisions
are
not
merely
imposed
from
the
top
but
that
there
be
some
actual
mechanism
of
faculty
participation
.
The
second
reason
for
being
concerned
with
the
dichotomy
between
faculty
members
who
are
part
of
the
``
in-group
''
that
owns
and
operates
the
institution
and
those
who
are
merely
paid
employees
,
is
,
therefore
,
the
baneful
effect
on
the
caliber
of
the
teaching
itself
.
This
is
a
problem
that
goes
considerably
beyond
questions
of
salary
and
tenure
.
Yet
though
it
may
seem
difficult
to
envision
any
definitive
resolution
of
the
problem
of
ownership
and
control
,
there
are
nevertheless
certain
suggestions
which
seem
to
be
in
order
.
The
first
is
a
negative
warning
:
there
is
no
point
in
the
creation
of
faculty
committees
and
advisory
boards
with
high-sounding
titles
but
no
real
authority
.
In
the
case
of
academic
personnel
the
``
feeling
''
of
participation
can
hardly
be
``
faked
''
.
Competent
teachers
are
well
versed
in
the
technique
of
leading
students
to
pre-set
conclusions
without
destroying
the
students'
illusion
that
they
are
making
their
own
decisions
.
Those
who
have
served
as
faculty
advisers
are
too
familiar
with
the
useful
but
artificial
mechanisms
of
student
government
to
be
taken
in
by
``
busy-work
''
and
ersatz
decision
making
.
In
any
case
it
is
by
no
means
clear
that
formally
structured
organs
of
participation
are
what
is
called
for
at
all
.
In
the
Notre
Dame
report
,
reference
was
made
to
the
fact
that
faculty
members
were
reduced
to
``
luncheon-table
communication
''
.
In
itself
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
form
of
``
participation
''
:
the
only
difficulty
on
the
Catholic
campus
is
that
those
faculty
members
who
are
in
a
position
to
implement
policy
,
i.e.
,
members
of
the
religious
community
which
owns
and
administers
the
institution
,
have
their
own
eating
arrangements
.
Sen.
John
L.
McClellan
of
Arkansas
and
Rep.
David
Martin
of
Nebraska
are
again
beating
the
drums
to
place
the
unions
under
the
anti-monopoly
laws
.
Once
more
the
fallacious
equation
is
advanced
to
argue
that
since
business
is
restricted
under
the
anti-monopoly
laws
,
there
must
be
a
corresponding
restriction
against
labor
unions
:
the
law
must
treat
everybody
equally
.
Or
,
in
the
words
of
Anatole
France
,
``
The
law
in
its
majestic
equality
must
forbid
the
rich
,
as
well
as
the
poor
,
from
begging
in
the
streets
and
sleeping
under
bridges
''
.
The
public
atmosphere
that
has
been
generated
which
makes
acceptance
of
this
law
a
possibility
stems
from
the
disrepute
into
which
the
labor
movement
has
fallen
as
a
result
of
Mr.
McClellan's
hearings
into
corruption
in
labor-management
relations
and
,
later
,
into
the
jurisdictional
squabbles
that
plagued
industrial
relations
at
the
missile
sites
.
The
Senator
was
shocked
by
stoppages
over
allegedly
trivial
disputes
that
delayed
our
missile
program
.
In
addition
,
disclosures
that
missile
workers
were
earning
sums
far
in
excess
of
what
is
paid
for
equivalent
work
elsewhere
provoked
his
indignation
on
behalf
of
the
American
taxpayer
who
was
footing
the
bill
.
It
is
now
disclosed
that
the
taxpayer
not
only
pays
for
high
wages
,
but
he
pays
the
employers'
strike
expenses
when
the
latter
undertakes
to
fight
a
strike
.
Business
Week
(
Aug.
9
,
1961
)
reports
that
the
United
Aircraft
Company
,
against
which
the
International
Association
of
Machinists
had
undertaken
a
strike
,
decided
to
keep
its
plants
operating
.
The
company
incurred
some
$10
million
of
expenses
attributable
to
four
factors
:
advertising
to
attract
new
employees
,
hiring
and
training
them
,
extra
overtime
,
and
defective
work
performed
by
the
new
workers
.
The
company
has
billed
the
United
States
Government
for
$7,500,000
of
these
expenses
under
the
Defense
Department
regulation
allowing
costs
of
a
type
generally
recognized
as
ordinary
and
necessary
for
the
conduct
of
the
contractor's
business
.
Rep.
Frank
Kowalski
of
Connecticut
has
brought
this
problem
to
the
attention
of
the
Armed
Services
Committee
.
The
committee
remains
unresponsive
.
Neither
has
Congressman
Martin
nor
Senator
McClellan
been
heard
from
on
the
matter
;
;
they
are
preoccupied
with
ending
labor
abuses
by
extending
the
anti-monopoly
laws
to
the
unions
.
The
recent
publicity
attending
the
successful
federal
prosecution
of
a
conspiracy
indictment
against
a
number
of
electrical
manufacturers
has
evoked
a
new
respect
for
the
anti-trust
laws
that
is
justified
neither
by
their
rationale
nor
by
the
results
they
have
obtained
.
The
anti-trust
laws
inform
a
business
that
it
must
compete
,
but
along
completely
undefined
lines
;
;
it
must
play
a
game
in
which
there
never
is
a
winner
.
The
fact
is
that
any
business
that
wants
to
operate
successfully
cannot
follow
the
law
.
Hypocrisy
thus
becomes
the
answer
to
a
foolish
public
policy
.
Let
us
look
at
the
heavy-electrical-goods
industry
in
which
General
Electric
,
Westinghouse
and
a
number
of
other
manufacturers
were
recently
convicted
of
engaging
in
a
conspiracy
to
rig
prices
and
allocate
the
market
.
The
industry
is
so
structured
that
price-setting
by
a
multi-product
company
will
vary
with
the
way
overhead
charges
are
allocated
--
whether
marginal
or
average
pricing
is
applied
.
The
problem
becomes
even
more
complex
where
an
enterprise
is
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
a
wide
variety
of
other
goods
in
addition
to
the
heavy
electrical
equipment
.
Accounting
procedures
can
be
varied
to
provide
a
rationale
for
almost
any
price
.
Naturally
,
enterprises
of
the
size
of
General
Electric
are
in
a
position
to
structure
their
prices
in
such
a
way
that
the
relatively
small
competitors
can
be
forced
to
the
wall
in
a
very
short
time
.
Should
these
giants
really
flex
their
competitive
muscles
,
they
would
become
the
only
survivors
in
the
industry
.
Uncle
Sam
would
then
accuse
them
of
creating
a
monopoly
by
``
unfair
competition
''
.
But
if
they
show
self-restraint
,
they
don't
get
the
orders
.
Under
the
circumstances
,
the
only
protection
for
the
relatively
small
manufacturers
is
to
engage
in
exactly
the
kind
of
conspiracy
with
the
giants
for
which
the
latter
were
convicted
.
Engaging
in
such
a
conspiracy
was
an
act
of
mercy
by
the
giants
.
The
paradox
implicit
in
the
whole
affair
is
shown
by
the
demand
of
the
government
,
after
the
conviction
,
that
General
Electric
sign
a
wide-open
consent
decree
that
it
would
not
reduce
prices
so
low
as
to
compete
seriously
with
its
fellows
.
In
other
words
,
the
anti-trust
laws
,
designed
to
reduce
prices
to
the
consumer
on
Monday
,
Wednesday
and
Friday
,
become
a
tool
to
protect
the
marginal
manufacturer
on
Tuesday
,
Thursday
and
Saturday
.
And
which
theory
would
govern
the
enforcers
of
the
law
on
Sunday
?
?
The
question
might
be
asked
:
``
Don't
the
managements
of
the
heavy-electrical-goods
manufacturers
know
these
facts
?
?
Why
did
they
engage
in
a
flood
of
mea
culpas
,
throw
a
few
scapegoats
to
the
dogs
and
promise
to
be
good
boys
thereafter
,
expressing
their
complete
confidence
in
the
laws
''
?
?
The
past
usefulness
of
the
anti-trust
laws
to
management
was
explained
by
Thurman
Arnold
,
in
The
Folklore
of
Capitalism
,
back
in
1937
.
He
wrote
:
``
(
P.
211
)
the
anti-trust
laws
were
the
answer
of
a
society
which
unconsciously
felt
the
need
of
great
organizations
,
and
at
the
same
time
had
to
deny
them
a
place
in
the
moral
and
logical
ideology
of
the
social
structure
.
(
P.
214
)
anti-trust
laws
became
the
greatest
protection
to
uncontrolled
business
dictatorship
.
(
P.
215
)
when
corporate
abuses
were
attacked
,
it
was
done
on
the
theory
that
criminal
penalties
would
be
invoked
rather
than
control
.
In
this
manner
,
every
scheme
for
direct
control
broke
to
pieces
on
the
great
protective
rock
of
the
anti-trust
laws
.
(
Pp.
228-229
)
in
any
event
,
it
is
obvious
that
the
anti-trust
laws
did
not
prevent
the
formation
of
some
of
the
greatest
financial
empires
the
world
has
ever
known
,
held
together
by
some
of
the
most
fantastic
ideas
,
all
based
on
the
fundamental
notion
that
a
corporation
is
an
individual
who
can
trade
and
exchange
goods
without
control
by
the
government
''
.
This
escape
from
control
has
led
to
management's
evaluating
the
risk
of
occasional
irrational
prosecution
as
worth
while
.
A
plea
of
nolo
contendere
,
followed
by
a
nominal
fine
,
after
all
is
a
small
price
to
pay
for
this
untrammeled
license
.
(
The
penalties
handed
out
in
the
electrical
case
,
which
included
jail
sentences
,
were
unprecedented
in
anti-trust
prosecutions
,
perhaps
because
the
conspirators
had
displayed
unusual
ineptness
in
their
pricing
activities
.
)
If
a
substitute
mechanism
is
needed
for
the
control
of
a
fictitious
impersonal
market
,
quite
obviously
some
method
must
be
devised
for
representing
the
public
interest
.
A
secret
conspiracy
of
manufacturers
is
hardly
such
a
vehicle
.
However
,
one
can
argue
that
no
such
control
is
necessary
as
long
as
one
pretends
that
the
anti-trust
laws
are
effective
and
rational
.
Quite
clearly
the
anti-trust
laws
are
neither
effective
nor
rational
--
and
yet
the
argument
goes
that
they
should
be
extended
to
the
labor
union
.
Those
who
favor
placing
trade
unions
under
anti-trust
laws
imply
that
they
are
advocating
a
brand
new
reform
.
Before
1933
,
individuals
who
opposed
trade
unions
and
collective
bargaining
said
so
in
plain
English
.
The
acceptance
of
collective
bargaining
as
a
national
policy
in
1934
,
implicit
in
the
writing
of
Section
7A
of
the
National
Industrial
Recovery
Act
,
has
made
it
impolitic
to
oppose
collective
bargaining
in
principle
.
The
Wagner
Act
,
the
Taft-Hartley
Act
and
the
Landrum-Griffin
Act
all
endorse
the
principle
of
collective
bargaining
.
The
basic
purpose
of
an
effective
collective-bargaining
system
is
the
removal
of
wages
from
competition
.
If
a
union
cannot
perform
this
function
,
then
collective
bargaining
is
being
palmed
off
by
organizers
as
a
gigantic
fraud
.
The
tortured
reasoning
that
unions
use
to
deny
their
ambition
to
exercise
monopoly
power
over
the
supply
and
price
of
labor
is
one
of
the
things
that
create
a
legal
profession
.
The
problem
must
be
faced
squarely
.
If
laborers
are
merely
commodities
competing
against
each
other
in
a
market
place
like
so
many
bags
of
wheat
and
corn
(
unsupported
,
by
the
way
,
by
any
agricultural
subsidy
)
,
then
they
may
be
pardoned
for
reacting
with
complete
antagonism
to
a
system
that
imposes
such
status
upon
them
.
Human
labor
was
exactly
that
--
a
commodity
--
in
eighteenth-
and
nineteenth-century
America
.
As
early
as
1776
,
Adam
Smith
wrote
in
The
Wealth
Of
Nations
:
``
We
have
no
acts
of
Parliament
against
combining
to
lower
the
price
of
work
;
;
but
many
against
combining
to
raise
it
''
.
Eighteenth-century
England
,
upon
whose
customs
our
common
law
was
built
,
had
outlawed
unions
as
monopolies
and
conspiracies
.
In
1825
,
the
Boston
house
carpenters'
strike
for
a
ten-hour
day
was
denounced
by
the
organized
employers
,
who
declared
:
``
It
is
considered
that
all
combinations
by
any
classes
of
citizens
intended
to
effect
the
value
of
labor
tend
to
convert
all
its
branches
into
monopolies
''
.
There
were
no
pious
hypocrisies
then
about
being
for
collective
bargaining
,
but
against
labor
monopoly
.
The
courts
shared
the
opinion
of
the
employers
.
In
People
vs.
Fisher
,
Justice
Savage
of
the
New
York
Supreme
Court
declared
:
``
Without
any
officious
and
improper
interference
on
the
subject
,
the
price
of
labor
or
the
wages
of
mechanics
will
be
regulated
by
the
demand
for
the
manufactured
article
and
the
value
of
that
which
is
paid
for
it
;
;
but
the
right
does
not
exist
to
raise
the
wages
of
the
mechanic
by
any
forced
and
artificial
means
''
.
Compare
this
statement
of
a
nineteenth-century
judge
with
how
Congressman
Martin
,
according
to
the
Daily
Labor
Report
of
Sept.
19
,
1961
,
defends
the
necessity
of
enacting
anti-trust
legislation
in
the
field
of
labor
``
if
we
wish
to
prevent
monopolistic
fixing
of
wages
,
production
or
prices
and
if
we
wish
to
preserve
the
freedom
of
the
employer
and
his
employees
to
contract
on
wages
,
hours
and
conditions
of
employment
''
.
Senator
McClellan
is
proposing
the
application
of
anti-trust
measures
to
unions
in
transportation
.
His
bill
,
allegedly
aimed
at
Hoffa
,
would
amend
the
Sherman
,
Clayton
and
Norris-LaGuardia
acts
to
authorize
the
issuance
of
federal
injunctions
in
any
transportation
strike
and
would
make
it
illegal
for
any
union
to
act
in
concert
with
any
other
union
--
even
a
sister
local
in
the
same
international
.
Paradoxically
,
the
same
week
in
which
Senator
McClellan
was
attempting
to
extend
the
anti-trust
act
to
labor
in
transportation
,
the
Civil
Aeronautics
Board
was
assuring
the
airlines
that
if
they
met
in
concert
to
eliminate
many
costly
features
of
air
travel
,
the
action
would
not
be
deemed
a
violation
of
the
anti-trust
act
.
Indeed
,
it
is
in
the
field
of
transportation
that
Congress
has
most
frequently
granted
employers
exemption
from
the
anti-trust
laws
;
;
for
example
,
the
organization
of
steamship
conferences
to
set
freight
rates
and
the
encouragement
of
railroads
to
seek
mergers
.
At
the
very
moment
that
every
attempt
is
being
made
to
take
management
out
from
under
the
irrationality
of
anti-trust
legislation
,
a
drive
is
on
to
abolish
collective
bargaining
under
the
guise
of
extending
the
anti-monopoly
laws
to
unions
who
want
no
more
than
to
continue
to
set
wages
in
the
same
way
that
ship
operators
set
freight
rates
.
The
passage
of
the
Sherman
Act
was
aimed
at
giant
monopolies
.
It
was
most
effective
against
trade
unions
.
In
the
famous
Danbury
Hatters
case
,
a
suit
was
brought
against
the
union
by
the
Loewe
Company
for
monopolistic
practices
,
e.g.
,
trying
to
persuade
consumers
not
to
purchase
the
product
of
the
struck
manufacturer
.
The
suit
against
the
union
was
successful
and
many
workers
lost
their
homes
to
pay
off
the
judgment
.
In
1914
,
the
Clayton
Act
attempted
to
take
labor
out
from
under
the
anti-trust
legislation
by
stating
that
human
labor
was
not
to
be
considered
a
commodity
.
The
law
could
not
suspend
economics
.
Labor
remained
a
commodity
--
but
presumably
a
privileged
one
granted
immunization
from
the
anti-trust
laws
.
The
courts
,
by
interpretation
,
emasculated
the
act
.
In
1922
,
the
United
Mine
Workers
struck
the
Coronado
Coal
Company
.
The
company
sued
under
the
anti-trust
laws
,
alleging
that
the
union's
activity
interfered
with
the
movement
of
interstate
commerce
.
(
What
other
purpose
could
a
striking
union
have
but
to
interrupt
the
flow
of
commerce
from
the
struck
enterprise
?
?
)
The
court
first
ruled
that
the
strike
constituted
only
an
indirect
interference
with
commerce
.
The
nation
the
three-front
war
At
a
closed-door
session
on
Capitol
Hill
last
week
,
Secretary
of
State
Christian
Herter
made
his
final
report
to
the
Senate
Foreign
Relations
Committee
on
U.S.
affairs
abroad
.
Afterward
,
Tennessee's
Democratic
Senator
Albert
Gore
summed
it
up
for
newsmen
.
What
Herter
presented
,
said
Gore
,
was
``
not
a
very
encouraging
review
''
.
That
was
something
of
an
understatement
in
a
week
when
the
underlying
conflict
between
the
West
and
Communism
erupted
on
three
fronts
.
While
Communists
were
undermining
United
Nations
efforts
to
rescue
the
Congo
from
chaos
,
two
other
Communist
offensives
stirred
the
Eisenhower
Administration
into
emergency
conferences
and
serious
decisions
.

)
Cuba
.
Hours
after
a
parade
of
his
new
Soviet
tanks
and
artillery
,
Dictator
Fidel
Castro
suddenly
confronted
the
U.S.
with
a
blunt
and
drastic
demand
:
within
48
hours
,
the
U.S.
had
to
reduce
its
embassy
and
consulate
staffs
in
Cuba
to
a
total
of
eleven
persons
(
the
embassy
staff
alone
totaled
87
U.S.
citizens
,
plus
120
Cuban
employees
)
.
President
Eisenhower
held
an
8:30
a.m.
meeting
with
top
military
and
foreign-policy
advisers
,
decided
to
break
off
diplomatic
relations
immediately
.
``
There
is
a
limit
to
what
the
United
States
in
self-respect
can
endure
''
,
said
the
President
.
``
That
limit
has
now
been
reached
''
.
Through
Secretary
Herter
,
Ike
offered
President-elect
Kennedy
an
opportunity
to
associate
his
new
Administration
with
the
breakoff
decision
.
Kennedy
,
through
Secretary-designate
of
State
Dean
Rusk
,
declined
.
He
thus
kept
his
hands
free
for
any
action
after
Jan.
20
,
although
reaction
to
the
break
was
generally
favorable
in
the
U.S.
and
Latin
America
(
see
the
hemisphere
)
.
2
)
Laos
.
After
a
White
House
huddle
between
the
President
and
top
lieutenants
,
the
Defense
Department
reacted
sharply
to
a
cry
from
the
pro-Western
government
of
Laos
that
several
battalions
of
Communist
troops
had
invaded
Laos
from
North
Viet
Nam
.
``
In
view
of
the
present
situation
in
Laos
''
,
said
the
Pentagon's
announcement
,
``
we
are
taking
normal
precautionary
actions
to
increase
the
readiness
of
our
forces
in
the
Pacific
''
.
Cutting
short
a
holiday
at
Hong
Kong
,
the
aircraft
carriers
Lexington
and
Bennington
steamed
off
into
the
South
China
Sea
,
accompanied
by
a
swarm
of
destroyers
,
plus
troopships
loaded
with
marines
.
On
the
U.S.'s
island
base
of
Okinawa
,
Task
Force

,
made
up
of
Army
,
Navy
,
Marine
and
Air
Force
units
,
got
braced
to
move
southward
on
signal
.
But
by
week's
end
the
Laotian
cry
of
invasion
was
read
as
an
exaggeration
(
see
foreign
news
)
,
and
the
U.S.
was
agreeing
with
its
cautious
British
and
French
allies
that
a
neutralist
--
rather
than
a
pro-Western
--
government
might
be
best
for
Laos
.
French
&
Indians
.
There
was
a
moral
of
sorts
in
the
Laotian
situation
that
said
much
about
all
other
cold-war
fronts
.
Political
,
economic
and
military
experts
were
all
agreed
that
chaotic
,
mountainous
little
Laos
was
the
last
place
in
the
world
to
fight
a
war
--
and
they
were
probably
right
.
``
It
would
be
like
fighting
the
French
and
Indian
War
all
over
again
''
,
said
one
military
man
.
But
why
was
Laos
the
new
Southeast
Asian
battleground
?
?
At
Geneva
in
1954
,
to
get
the
war
in
Indo-China
settled
,
the
British
and
French
gave
in
to
Russian
and
Communist
Chinese
demands
and
agreed
to
the
setting
up
of
a
Communist
state
,
North
Viet
Nam
--
which
then
,
predictably
,
became
a
base
for
Communist
operations
against
neighboring
South
Viet
Nam
and
Laos
.
The
late
Secretary
of
State
John
Foster
Dulles
considered
the
1954
Geneva
agreement
a
specimen
of
appeasement
,
saw
that
resolution
would
be
needed
to
keep
it
from
becoming
a
calamity
for
the
West
.
He
began
the
diplomatic
discussions
that
resulted
in
the
establishment
of
Aj
.
``
The
important
thing
from
now
on
''
,
he
said
,
``
is
not
to
mourn
the
past
but
to
seize
the
future
opportunity
to
prevent
the
loss
in
northern
Viet
Nam
from
leading
to
the
extension
of
Communism
throughout
Southeast
Asia
''
.

drops

(
using
the
same
Ilyushin

were
used
to
carry

agents

)
made
it
plain
once
more
that
the
cold
war
was
all
of
a
piece
in
space
and
time
.
Soviet
Premier
Khrushchev
sent
New
Year's
hopes
for
peace
to
President-elect
Kennedy
,
and
got
a
cool
acknowledgment
in
reply
.
Considering
the
state
of
the
whole
world
,
the
cold
war's
three
exposed
fronts
did
not
seem
terribly
ominous
;
;
but
,
in
Senator
Gore's
words
,
it
was
``
not
a
very
encouraging
''
situation
that
would
confront
John
F.
Kennedy
on
Inauguration
Day
.
The
Congress
turmoil
in
the
House
As
the
87th
Congress
began
its
sessions
last
week
,
liberal
Democrats
were
ready
for
a
finish
fight
to
open
the
sluice
gates
controlled
by
the
House
Rules
Committee
and
permit
the
free
flow
of
liberal
legislation
to
the
floor
.
The
liberal
pressure
bloc
(
which
coyly
masquerades
under
the
name
Democratic
Study
Group
)
had
fought
the
committee
before
,
and
had
always
lost
.
This
time
,
they
were
much
better
prepared
and
organized
,
and
the
political
climate
was
favorable
.
They
had
the
unspoken
support
of
President-elect
Kennedy
,
whose
own
legislative
program
was
menaced
by
the
Rules
Committee
bottleneck
.
And
counting
noses
,
they
seemed
to
have
the
votes
to
work
their
will
.
Deadly
deadlock
.
There
were
two
possible
methods
of
breaching
the
conservative
barriers
around
the
Rules
Committee
:
1
)
to
pack
it
with
additional
liberals
and
break
the
conservative-liberal
deadlock
,
or
2
)
to
remove
one
of
the
conservatives
--
namely
Mississippi's
14-term
William
Meyers
Colmer
(
pronounced
Calmer
)
.
Caucusing
,
the
liberals
decided
to
go
after
Colmer
,
which
actually
was
the
more
drastic
course
,
since
seniority
in
the
House
is
next
to
godliness
.
A
dour
,
gangling
man
with
a
choppy
gait
,
Colmer
looks
younger
than
his
70
years
,
has
gradually
swung
from
a
moderate
,
internationalist
position
to
that
of
a
diehard
conservative
.
He
is
generally
and
initially
suspicious
of
any
federal
project
,
unless
it
happens
to
benefit
his
Gulf
Coast
constituents
.
He
is
,
of
course
,
a
segregationist
,
but
he
says
he
has
never
made
an
``
anti-Negro
''
speech
.
For
20
years
he
has
enjoyed
his
power
on
the
Rules
Committee
.
There
his
vote
,
along
with
those
of
Chairman
Howard
Smith
,
the
courtly
Virginia
judge
,
and
the
four
Republican
members
,
could
and
often
did
produce
a
6-6
deadlock
that
blocked
far-out
,
Democratic-sponsored
welfare
legislation
(
a
tactic
often
acceptable
to
the
Rayburn-Johnson
congressional
leadership
to
avoid
embarrassing
votes
)
.
Equal
treatment
.
There
was
sufficient
pretext
to
demand
Colmer's
ouster
:
he
had
given
his
lukewarm
support
to
the
anti-Kennedy
electors
in
Mississippi
.
Reprisals
are
not
unheard
of
in
such
situations
,
but
the
recent
tendency
has
been
for
the
Congress
to
forgive
its
prodigal
sons
.
In
1949
the
Dixiecrats
escaped
unscathed
after
their
1948
rebellion
against
Harry
Truman
,
and
in
1957
,
after
Congressman
Adam
Clayton
Powell
campaigned
for
Dwight
Eisenhower
in
1956
,
his
fellow
Democrats
did
not
touch
his
committee
assignments
,
although
they
did
strip
him
temporarily
of
his
patronage
.
(
In
the
heat
of
the
anti-Colmer
drive
last
week
,
Judge
Smith
threatened
reprisal
against
Powell
.
Said
he
:
``
We
will
see
whether
whites
and
Negroes
are
treated
the
same
around
here
''
.
)
But
Speaker
Sam
Rayburn
,
after
huddling
in
Palm
Beach
with
President-elect
Kennedy
,
decided
that
this
year
something
had
to
be
done
about
the
Rules
Committee
--
and
that
he
was
the
only
man
who
could
do
anything
effective
.
In
a
tense
,
closed-door
session
with
Judge
Smith
,
Rayburn
attempted
to
work
out
a
compromise
:
to
add
three
new
members
to
the
Rules
Committee
(
two
Democrats
,
including
one
Southerner
,
and
one
Republican
)
.
Smith
flatly
rejected
the
offer
,
and
Mister
Sam
thereupon
decided
to
join
the
rebels
.
The
next
morning
he
summoned
a
group
of
top
Democrats
to
his
private
office
and
broke
the
news
:
he
would
lead
the
fight
to
oust
Colmer
,
whom
he
is
said
to
regard
as
``
an
inferior
man
''
.
News
of
Rayburn's
commitment
soon
leaked
out
.
When
Missouri's
Clarence
Cannon
got
the
word
,
he
turned
purple
.
``
Unconscionable
''
!
!
He
shouted
,
and
rushed
off
to
the
Speaker's
Room
to
object
:
``
A
dangerous
precedent
''
!
!
Cannon
,
a
powerful
,
conservative
man
,
brought
welcome
support
to
the
Smith-Colmer
forces
:
as
chairman
of
the
Appropriations
Committee
,
he
holds
over
each
member
the
dreadful
threat
of
excluding
this
or
that
congressional
district
from
federal
pork-barrel
projects
.
Sitting
quietly
on
an
equally
big
pork
barrel
was
another
Judge
Smith
ally
,
Georgia's
Carl
Vinson
,
chairman
of
the
Armed
Services
Committee
.
Threat
of
war
.
As
the
battle
raged
in
the
cloakrooms
and
caucuses
,
it
became
clear
that
Judge
Smith
could
lose
.
His
highest
count
of
supporters
numbered
72
--
and
he
needed
nearly
twice
that
number
to
control
the
260-member
Democratic
caucus
.
The
liberals
,
smelling
blood
,
were
faced
with
the
necessity
of
winning
three
big
votes
--
in
the
Democratic
Committee
on
Committees
,
in
the
full
party
caucus
,
and
on
the
floor
of
the
House
--
before
they
could
oust
Colmer
.
(
One
big
question
:
If
Colmer
was
to
be
purged
,
what
should
the
House
do
about
the
other
three
senior
Mississippians
who
supported
the
maverick
electors
?
?
)
In
all
three
arenas
,
they
seemed
certain
of
victory
--
especially
with
Sam
Rayburn
applying
his
whiplash
.
But
in
the
prospect
of
winning
the
battle
loomed
the
specter
of
losing
a
costlier
war
.
If
the
Southerners
were
sufficiently
aroused
,
they
could
very
well
cut
the
Kennedy
legislative
program
to
ribbons
from
their
vantage
point
of
committee
chairmanships
,
leaving
Sam
Rayburn
leading
a
truncated
,
unworkable
party
.
With
that
possibility
in
mind
,
Arkansas'
Wilbur
Mills
deliberately
delayed
calling
a
meeting
of
the
Committee
on
Committees
,
and
coolheaded
Democrats
sought
to
bring
Rayburn
and
Smith
together
again
to
work
out
some
sort
of
face-saving
compromise
.
``
Here
are
two
old
men
,
mad
at
each
other
and
too
proud
to
pick
up
the
phone
''
,
said
a
House
Democratic
leader
.
``
One
wants
a
little
more
power
,
and
the
other
doesn't
want
to
give
up
any
''
.
Battle
in
the
senate
The
Senate
launched
the
87th
Congress
with
its
own
version
of
an
ancient
liberal-conservative
battle
,
but
in
contrast
with
the
House's
guerrilla
war
it
seemed
as
pro
forma
as
a
Capitol
guide's
speech
.
Question
at
issue
:
How
big
a
vote
should
be
necessary
to
restrict
Senate
debate
--
and
thereby
cut
off
legislation-delaying
filibusters
?
?
A
wide-ranging
,
bipartisan
force
--
from
Minnesota's
Democratic
Hubert
Humphrey
to
Massachusetts'
Republican
Leverett
Saltonstall
--
was
drawn
up
against
a
solid
phalanx
of
Southern
Democrats
,
who
have
traditionally
used
the
filibuster
to
stop
civil
rights
bills
.
New
Mexico's
Clint
Anderson
offered
a
resolution
to
change
the
Senate's
notorious
Rule
22
to
allow
three-fifths
of
the
Senators
present
and
voting
to
cut
off
debate
,
instead
of
the
current
hard-to-get
two-thirds
.
Fair
Dealer
Humphrey
upped
the
ante
,
asked
cloture
power
for
a
mere
majority
of
Senators
.
Georgia's
Dick
Russell
objected
politely
,
and
the
battle
was
joined
.
Privately
,
the
liberals
admitted
that
the
Humphrey
amendment
had
no
chance
of
passage
.
Privately
,
they
also
admitted
that
their
hopes
for
Clint
Anderson's
three-fifths
modification
depended
on
none
other
than
Republican
Richard
Nixon
.
In
1957
Nixon
delivered
a
significant
opinion
that
a
majority
of
Senators
had
the
power
to
adopt
new
rules
at
the
beginning
of
each
new
Congress
,
and
that
any
rules
laid
down
by
previous
Congresses
were
not
binding
.
Armed
with
the
Nixon
opinion
,
the
Senate
liberals
rounded
up
their
slim
majority
and
prepared
to
choke
off
debate
on
the
filibuster
battle
this
week
.
Hopefully
,
the
perennial
battle
of
Rule
22
then
would
be
fought
to
a
settlement
once
and
for
all
.
Republicans
last
act
Since
Election
Day
,
Vice
President
Richard
Nixon
had
virtually
retired
--
by
his
own
wish
--
from
public
view
.
But
with
the
convening
of
the
new
Congress
,
he
was
the
public
man
again
,
presiding
over
the
Senate
until
John
Kennedy's
Inauguration
.
One
day
last
week
,
Nixon
faced
a
painful
constitutional
chore
that
required
him
to
officiate
at
a
joint
session
of
Congress
to
hear
the
official
tally
of
the
Electoral
College
vote
,
and
then
to
make
``
sufficient
declaration
''
of
the
election
of
the
man
who
defeated
him
in
the
tight
1960
presidential
election
.
Nixon
fulfilled
his
assignment
with
grace
,
then
went
beyond
the
required
``
sufficient
declaration
''
.
``
This
is
the
first
time
in
100
years
that
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
announced
the
result
of
an
election
in
which
he
was
defeated
''
,
he
said
.
The
Masters
golf
tournament
proved
last
Monday
what
it
can
do
to
the
strongest
men
and
the
staunchest
nerves
.
Gary
Player
,
the
small
,
trim
South
African
,
was
the
eventual
winner
,
but
in
all
his
25
years
he
never
spent
a
more
harrowing
afternoon
as
he
waited
for
the
victory
to
drop
in
his
lap
.
Arnold
Palmer
,
the
defending
champion
,
lost
his
title
on
the
72nd
hole
after
a
few
minutes
of
misfortune
that
left
even
his
fellow
pros
gaping
in
disbelief
.
``
Just
when
you
think
you
have
it
licked
,
this
golf
course
can
get
up
and
bite
you
''
,
Player
had
said
one
afternoon
midway
through
the
tournament
.
And
that
is
just
what
happened
on
the
last
few
holes
.
The
Augusta
National
Golf
Club
Course
got
up
and
bit
both
Player
and
Palmer
.
Player
was
the
first
to
feel
its
teeth
.
After
playing
a
splendid
first
nine
holes
in
34
--
two
strokes
under
par
--
on
this
fifth
and
final
day
of
the
tournament
(
Sunday's
fourth
round
had
been
washed
out
by
a
violent
rainstorm
when
it
was
only
half
completed
)
,
Player's
game
rapidly
fell
to
pieces
.
He
bogeyed
the
10th
.
After
a
journey
through
woods
and
stream
he
double-bogeyed
the
13th
.
He
bogeyed
the
15th
by
missing
a
short
putt
and
finally
scrambled
through
the
last
three
holes
without
further
mishap
for
a
2-over-par
74
and
a
72-hole
total
of
280
.
As
he
signed
his
scorecard
and
walked
off
the
course
,
Player
was
almost
in
tears
.
He
could
read
on
the
nearby
scoreboard
that
Palmer
,
by
then
playing
the
15th
hole
,
was
leading
him
by
a
stroke
.
Palmer
had
started
the
round
four
strokes
behind
Player
,
and
at
one
point
in
the
afternoon
had
trailed
by
as
many
as
six
strokes
.
Now
all
he
had
to
do
was
finish
in
even
par
to
collect
the
trophy
and
the
biggest
single
paycheck
in
golf
.
When
Palmer
hit
a
good
straight
drive
up
the
fairway
on
the
72nd
hole
,
he
seemed
to
have
the
championship
won
.
But
the
seven-iron
shot
he
used
to
approach
the
green
strayed
into
a
bunker
and
lodged
in
a
slight
depression
.
In
trying
to
hit
it
out
with
a
sand
wedge
Palmer
bounced
the
ball
over
the
green
,
past
spectators
and
down
the
slope
toward
a
TV
tower
.
Afterwards
,
Palmer
told
Charlie
Coe
,
his
last-round
partner
,
that
he
simply
played
the
hole
too
fast
.
He
did
seem
hasty
on
his
second
and
third
shots
,
but
then
there
was
an
agonizing
wait
of
several
minutes
while
Coe
graciously
putted
out
,
giving
Palmer
a
chance
to
recover
his
composure
,
which
he
had
quite
visibly
lost
.
When
the
shaken
Palmer
finally
did
hit
his
fourth
shot
,
he
overshot
the
hole
by
15
feet
.
Palmer
was
now
putting
merely
for
a
tie
,
and
Player
,
who
was
sitting
beside
his
wife
and
watching
it
all
on
television
in
Tournament
Chairman
Clifford
Roberts'
clubhouse
apartment
,
stared
in
amazement
when
Palmer
missed
the
putt
.
Palmer's
281
for
the
four
rounds
at
Augusta
was
a
comfortable
four
strokes
ahead
of
the
next
closest
pro
,
but
it
was
barely
good
enough
for
a
second-place
tie
with
Coe
.
The
lean
and
leathery
Oklahoma
amateur
,
who
has
been
playing
topnotch
tournament
golf
for
many
years
,
refused
to
let
the
Masters
jitters
overtake
him
and
closed
the
tournament
with
his
second
straight
69
.
End
at
seven
Until
late
last
Saturday
afternoon
Palmer
had
played
seven
consecutive
rounds
of
golf
at
the
Masters
--
four
last
year
and
three
this
--
without
ever
being
out
of
first
place
.
As
evening
approached
and
Palmer
finished
his
Saturday
round
with
a
disappointing
one-over-par
73
,
this
remarkable
record
was
still
intact
,
thanks
to
his
Thursday
and
Friday
rounds
of
68
and
69
.
His
three-round
total
of
210
was
three
strokes
better
than
the
next
best
score
,
a
213
by
Bill
Collins
,
the
tall
and
deliberate
Baltimorean
who
had
been
playing
very
well
all
winter
long
.
But
Palmer
knew
,
as
did
everybody
else
at
Augusta
,
that
his
streak
was
about
to
be
broken
.
Half
an
hour
after
he
finished
his
round
,
Player
holed
out
at
the
18th
green
with
a
69
and
a
three-round
total
of
206
,
four
strokes
ahead
of
Palmer
.
More
than
a
streak
had
ended
.
Long
after
the
erratic
climate
and
the
washed-out
final
round
on
Sunday
have
become
meteorological
footnotes
,
the
1961
Masters
will
be
remembered
as
the
scene
of
the
mano
a
mano
between
Arnold
Palmer
and
Gary
Player
.
Unlike
most
such
sports
rivalries
,
it
appeared
to
have
developed
almost
spontaneously
,
although
this
was
not
exactly
the
case
.
When
the
winter
tour
began
at
Los
Angeles
last
January
there
was
no
one
in
sight
to
challenge
Palmer's
towering
prestige
.
As
if
to
confirm
his
stature
,
he
quickly
won
three
of
the
first
eight
tournaments
.
Player
won
only
one
.
But
as
the
tour
reached
Pensacola
a
month
ago
,
Player
was
leading
Palmer
in
official
winnings
by
a
few
hundred
dollars
,
and
the
rest
of
the
field
was
somewhere
off
in
nowhere
.
On
the
final
round
at
Pensacola
,
the
luck
of
the
draw
paired
Palmer
and
Player
in
the
same
threesome
and
,
although
it
was
far
from
obvious
at
the
time
,
the
gallery
was
treated
to
the
first
chapter
of
what
promises
to
be
one
of
the
most
exciting
duels
in
sport
for
a
long
time
to
come
.
On
that
final
Sunday
at
Pensacola
neither
Palmer
nor
Player
was
leading
the
tournament
and
,
as
it
turned
out
,
neither
won
it
.
But
whichever
of
these
two
finished
ahead
of
the
other
would
be
the
undisputed
financial
leader
of
the
tour
.
Player
immediately
proved
he
was
not
in
the
least
awed
by
the
dramatic
proximity
of
Palmer
.
He
outplayed
Palmer
all
around
the
course
and
finished
with
a
tremendous
65
to
Palmer's
71
.
Thereafter
,
until
the
Masters
,
Player
gradually
increased
his
lead
over
Palmer
in
winnings
and
added
one
more
tournament
victory
at
Miami
.
When
they
reached
Augusta
last
week
,
together
they
had
won
five
of
the
13
tournaments
to
date
.
Instant
rivalry
On
Thursday
,
the
first
day
of
the
Masters
,
the
contest
between
Palmer
and
Player
developed
instantly
.
It
was
a
dismal
,
drizzly
day
but
a
good
one
on
which
to
score
over
the
Augusta
National
course
.
The
usually
skiddy
greens
were
moist
and
soft
,
so
the
golfers
were
able
to
strike
their
approach
shots
boldly
at
the
flag-stick
and
putt
firmly
toward
the
hole
without
too
much
worry
about
the
consequences
.
Palmer's
4-under-par
68
got
him
off
to
an
early
lead
,
which
he
shared
with
Bob
Rosburg
.
But
Player
was
only
one
stroke
back
,
with
a
69
.
Even
so
,
it
was
still
not
clear
to
many
in
the
enormous
horde
of
spectators
--
unquestionably
the
largest
golf
crowd
ever
--
that
this
tournament
was
to
be
,
essentially
,
a
match
between
Palmer
and
Player
.
A
lot
of
people
were
still
thinking
about
Jack
Nicklaus
,
the
spectacular
young
amateur
,
who
had
a
70
;
;
or
Ken
Venturi
,
who
had
a
somewhat
shaky
72
but
was
bound
to
do
better
;
;
or
Rosburg
,
whose
accurate
short
game
and
supersensitive
putter
can
overcome
so
many
of
Augusta's
treacheries
;
;
or
even
old
Byron
Nelson
,
whose
excellent
71
made
one
wonder
if
he
had
solved
the
geriatric
aspects
of
golf
.
(
On
Thursday
nobody
except
Charlie
Coe
was
thinking
of
Charlie
Coe
.
)
On
Friday
,
a
day
as
cloudless
and
lovely
as
Thursday
had
been
gray
and
ugly
,
the
plot
of
the
tournament
came
clearly
into
focus
.
Rosburg
had
started
early
in
the
day
,
and
by
the
time
Palmer
and
Player
were
on
the
course
--
separated
,
as
they
were
destined
to
be
for
the
rest
of
the
weekend
,
by
about
half
an
hour
--
they
could
see
on
the
numerous
scoreboards
spotted
around
the
course
that
Rosburg
,
who
ended
with
a
73
,
was
not
having
a
good
day
.
As
Player
began
his
second
round
in
a
twosome
with
amateur
Bill
Hyndman
,
his
share
of
the
gallery
was
not
conspicuously
large
for
a
contender
.
Player
began
with
a
birdie
on
the
first
hole
,
added
five
straight
pars
and
then
another
birdie
at
the
9th
.
On
the
back
nine
he
began
to
acquire
the
tidal
wave
of
a
gallery
that
stayed
with
him
the
rest
of
the
tournament
.
He
birdied
the
13th
,
the
15th
and
the
18th
--
five
birdies
,
one
bogey
and
12
pars
for
a
68
.
Starting
half
an
hour
behind
Player
in
company
with
British
Open
Champion
Kel
Nagle
,
Palmer
birdied
the
2nd
,
the
9th
,
the
13th
and
the
16th
--
four
birdies
,
one
bogey
and
13
pars
for
a
69
.
The
roar
of
Palmer's
gallery
as
he
sank
a
thrilling
putt
would
roll
out
across
the
parklike
landscape
of
Augusta
,
only
to
be
answered
moments
later
by
the
roar
of
Player's
gallery
for
a
similar
triumph
.
At
one
point
late
in
the
day
,
when
Palmer
was
lining
up
a
25-foot
putt
on
the
16th
,
a
thunderous
cheer
from
the
direction
of
the
18th
green
unmistakably
announced
that
Player
had
birdied
the
final
hole
.
Without
so
much
as
a
grimace
or
a
gesture
to
show
that
he
had
noticed
(
although
he
later
admitted
that
he
had
)
Palmer
proceeded
to
sink
his
25-footer
,
and
his
gallery
sent
its
explosive
vocalization
rolling
back
along
the
intervening
fairways
in
reply
.
The
boldness
of
champions
Anyone
who
now
doubted
that
a
personal
duel
was
under
way
had
only
to
watch
how
these
exceptionally
gifted
golfers
were
playing
this
most
difficult
golf
course
.
It
is
almost
axiomatic
that
golfers
who
dominate
the
game
of
golf
for
any
period
of
time
attack
their
shots
with
a
vehemence
bordering
on
violence
.
The
bad
luck
that
can
so
often
mar
a
well-played
round
of
golf
is
simply
overpowered
and
obliterated
by
the
contemptuous
boldness
of
these
champions
.
Bob
Jones
played
that
way
.
Byron
Nelson
did
,
Hogan
did
.
And
last
week
at
the
Masters
Palmer
and
Player
did
.
As
the
third
round
of
the
tournament
began
on
Saturday
and
the
duel
was
resumed
in
earnest
,
it
was
Player's
superior
aggressiveness
that
carried
him
into
the
lead
.
This
day
Palmer
had
started
first
.
As
Player
stepped
on
the
first
tee
he
knew
that
Palmer
had
birdied
the
first
two
holes
and
already
was
2
under
par
for
the
day
.
Player
immediately
proceeded
to
follow
suit
.
In
fact
,
he
went
on
to
birdie
the
6th
and
8th
as
well
,
to
go
4
under
par
for
the
first
eight
holes
.
But
Player's
real
test
came
on
the
ninth
hole
,
a
downhill
dogleg
to
the
left
measuring
420
yards
.
He
hit
a
poor
tee
shot
,
pulling
it
off
into
the
pine
woods
separating
the
9th
and
first
fairways
.
Having
hit
one
of
the
trees
,
the
ball
came
to
rest
not
more
than
160
yards
out
.
Player
then
had
the
choice
of
punching
the
ball
safely
out
of
the
woods
to
the
9th
fairway
and
settling
for
a
bogey
5
,
or
gambling
.
The
latter
involved
hitting
a
full
four-wood
out
to
the
first
fairway
and
toward
the
clubhouse
,
hoping
to
slice
it
back
to
the
deeply
bunkered
9th
green
.
``
I
was
hitting
the
ball
well
''
,
Player
said
later
,
``
and
I
felt
strong
.
When
you're
playing
like
that
you'd
better
attack
''
.
Player
attacked
with
his
four-wood
and
hit
a
shot
that
few
who
saw
it
will
ever
forget
.
It
struck
the
9th
green
on
the
fly
and
stopped
just
off
the
edge
.
From
there
he
chipped
back
and
sank
his
putt
for
a
par
4
.
Palmer
,
meanwhile
,
had
been
having
his
troubles
.
They
started
on
the
4th
hole
,
a
220-yard
par-3
.
On
this
day
the
wind
had
switched
180-degrees
from
the
northwest
to
the
southeast
,
and
nearly
every
shot
on
the
course
was
different
from
the
previous
few
days
.
At
the
4th
tee
Palmer
chose
to
hit
a
one-iron
when
a
three-wood
was
the
proper
club
,
so
he
put
the
ball
in
a
bunker
in
front
of
the
green
.
His
bogey
4
on
this
hole
and
subsequent
bogeys
at
5
and
7
along
with
a
birdie
at
8
brought
him
back
to
even
par
.
Starting
the
second
nine
,
Palmer
was
already
four
strokes
behind
Player
and
knew
it
.
When
Mickey
Charles
Mantle
,
the
New
York
Yankees'
man
of
muscle
,
drives
a
home
run
450
feet
into
the
bleachers
,
his
feat
touches
upon
the
sublime
.
When
Roger
Eugene
Maris
,
Mantle's
muscular
teammate
,
powers
four
home
runs
in
a
double-header
,
his
performance
merits
awe
.
But
when
tiny
,
145-pound
Albert
Gregory
Pearson
of
the
Los
Angeles
Angels
,
who
once
caught
three
straight
fly
balls
in
center
field
because
,
as
a
teammate
explained
,
``
the
other
team
thought
no
one
was
out
there
''
,
hits
seven
home
runs
in
four
months
(
three
more
than
his
total
in
1958
,
1959
,
and
1960
)
,
his
achievement
borders
on
the
ridiculous
.
This
is
Baseball
1961
.
This
is
the
year
home
runs
ranged
from
the
sublime
to
the
ridiculous
.
It
is
the
year
when
(
1
)
amiable
Jim
Gentile
of
the
Baltimore
Orioles
ambled
to
the
plate
in
consecutive
innings
with
the
bases
loaded
and
,
in
unprecedented
style
,
delivered
consecutive
grand-slam
home
runs
;
;
(
2
)
Willie
Mays
of
the
San
Francisco
Giants
borrowed
a
teammate's
bat
and
became
the
ninth
big
leaguer
to
stroke
four
home
runs
in
a
game
;
;
(
3
)
the
Milwaukee
Braves
tied
a
major-league
record
with
fourteen
home
runs
in
three
games
and
lost
two
of
them
;
;
and
(
4
)
catcher
Johnny
Blanchard
of
the
New
York
Yankees
matched
a
record
with
home
runs
in
four
successive
times
at
bat
,
two
of
them
as
a
pinch-hitter
.
Pitchers
grumble
about
lively
balls
and
lively
bats
,
the
shrinking
strike
zone
,
and
the
fact
that
the
knock-down
pitch
is
now
illegal
.
Experts
point
to
the
thinning
of
pitching
talent
in
the
American
League
caused
by
expansion
.
Whatever
the
reasons
,
not
in
30
years
has
a
single
season
produced
such
thunderous
assaults
upon
the
bureau
of
baseball
records
,
home-run
division
.
Of
all
the
records
in
peril
,
one
stands
apart
,
dramatic
in
its
making
,
dramatic
in
its
endurance
,
and
now
,
doubly
dramatic
in
its
jeopardy
.
This
,
of
course
,
is
baseball's
most
remarkable
mark
:
The
60
home
runs
hit
in
1927
by
the
incorrigible
epicure
,
the
incredible
athlete
,
George
Herman
(
Babe
)
Ruth
of
the
Yankees
.
Since
1927
,
fewer
than
a
dozen
men
have
made
serious
runs
at
Babe
Ruth's
record
and
each
,
in
turn
,
has
been
thwarted
.
What
ultimately
frustrated
every
challenger
was
Ruth's
amazing
September
surge
.
In
the
final
month
of
the
1927
season
,
he
hit
seventeen
home
runs
,
a
closing
spurt
never
matched
.
Double
threat
:
Always
,
in
the
abortive
attacks
upon
Ruth's
record
,
one
man
alone
--
a
Jimmy
Foxx
(
58
in
1932
)
or
a
Hank
Greenberg
(
58
in
1938
)
or
a
Hack
Wilson
(
56
in
1930
)
--
made
the
bid
.
But
now
,
for
the
first
time
since
Lou
Gehrig
(
with
47
home
runs
)
spurred
Ruth
on
in
1927
,
two
men
playing
for
the
same
team
have
zeroed
in
on
60
.
Their
names
are
Mantle
and
Maris
,
their
team
is
the
Yankees
,
and
their
threat
is
real
.
After
108
games
in
1927
,
Ruth
had
35
home
runs
.
After
108
games
in
1961
,
Mickey
Mantle
has
43
,
Roger
Maris
41
.
Extend
Mantle's
and
Maris's
present
paces
over
the
full
1961
schedule
of
162
games
,
and
,
mathematically
,
each
will
hit
more
than
60
home
runs
.
This
is
the
great
edge
the
two
Yankees
have
going
for
them
.
To
better
Ruth's
mark
,
neither
needs
a
spectacular
September
flourish
.
All
Mantle
needs
is
eight
more
home
runs
in
August
and
ten
in
September
,
and
he
will
establish
a
new
record
.
In
Ruth's
day
--
and
until
this
year
--
the
schedule
was
154
games
.
Baseball
commissioner
Ford
Frick
has
ruled
that
Ruth's
record
will
remain
official
unless
it
is
broken
in
154
games
.
)
``
Even
on
the
basis
of
154
games
,
this
is
the
ideal
situation
''
,
insists
Hank
Greenberg
,
now
vice-president
of
the
Chicago
White
Sox
.
``
It
has
to
be
easier
with
two
of
them
.
How
can
you
walk
Maris
to
get
to
Mantle
''
?
?
Roommates
:
Neither
Mantle
nor
Maris
,
understandably
,
will
predict
60
home
runs
for
himself
.
Although
both
concede
they
would
like
to
hit
60
,
they
stick
primarily
to
the
baseball
player's
standard
quote
:
``
The
important
thing
is
to
win
the
pennant
''
.
But
one
thing
is
for
certain
:
There
is
no
dissension
between
Mantle
,
the
American
League's
Most
Valuable
Player
in
1956
and
1957
,
and
Maris
,
the
MVP
in
1960
.
Each
enjoys
seeing
the
other
hit
home
runs
(
``
I
hope
Roger
hits
80
''
,
Mantle
says
)
,
and
each
enjoys
even
more
seeing
himself
hit
home
runs
(
``
and
I
hope
I
hit
81
''
)
.
The
sluggers
get
along
so
well
in
fact
,
that
with
their
families
at
home
for
the
summer
(
Mantle's
in
Dallas
,
Maris's
in
Kansas
City
)
,
they
are
rooming
together
.
Mantle
,
Maris
,
and
Bob
Cerv
,
a
utility
outfielder
,
share
an
apartment
in
Jamaica
,
Long
Island
,
not
far
from
New
York
International
Airport
.
The
three
pay
$251
a
month
for
four
rooms
(
kitchen
,
dining
room
,
living
room
,
and
bedroom
)
,
with
air-conditioning
and
new
modern
furniture
.
Mantle
and
Cerv
use
the
twin
beds
in
the
bedroom
;
;
Maris
sleeps
on
a
green
studio
couch
in
the
living
room
.
They
divide
up
the
household
chores
:
Cerv
does
most
of
the
cooking
(
breakfast
and
sandwich
snacks
,
with
dinner
out
)
,
Mantle
supplies
the
transportation
(
a
white
1961
Oldsmobile
convertible
)
,
and
Maris
drives
the
25-minute
course
from
the
apartment
house
to
Yankee
Stadium
.
Mantle
,
Maris
,
and
Cerv
probably
share
one
major-league
record
already
:
Among
them
,
they
have
fifteen
children
--
eight
for
Cerv
,
four
for
Mantle
,
and
three
for
Maris
.
As
roommates
,
teammates
,
and
home-run
mates
,
Mantle
,
29
,
who
broke
in
with
the
Yankees
ten
years
ago
,
and
Maris
,
26
,
who
came
to
the
Yankees
from
Kansas
City
two
years
ago
,
have
strikingly
similar
backgrounds
.
Both
were
scholastic
stars
in
football
,
basketball
,
and
baseball
(
Mantle
in
Commerce
,
Okla.
,
Maris
in
Fargo
,
N.D.
)
;
;
as
halfbacks
,
both
came
close
to
playing
football
at
the
University
of
Oklahoma
(
``
Sometimes
in
the
minors
''
,
Maris
recalls
,
``
I
wished
I
had
gone
to
Oklahoma
''
)
.
To
an
extent
,
the
two
even
look
alike
.
Both
have
blue
eyes
and
short
blond
hair
.
Both
are
6
feet
tall
and
weigh
between
195
and
200
pounds
,
but
Mantle
,
incredibly
muscular
(
he
has
a
17-1/2-inch
neck
)
,
looks
bigger
.
With
their
huge
backs
and
overdeveloped
shoulders
,
both
must
have
their
clothes
made
to
order
.
Maris
purchases
$100
suits
from
Simpson's
in
New
York
.
Mantle
,
more
concerned
with
dress
,
buys
his
suits
four
at
a
time
at
Neiman-Marcus
in
Dallas
and
pays
as
much
as
$250
each
.
Light
reading
:
Neither
Mantle
nor
Maris
need
fear
being
classified
an
intellectual
,
but
lately
Mantle
has
shown
unusual
devotion
to
an
intellectual
opus
,
Henry
Miller's
``
Tropic
of
Cancer
''
.
Mantle
so
appreciated
Miller's
delicate
literary
style
that
he
broadened
teammates'
minds
by
reading
sensitive
passages
aloud
during
road
trips
.
Mantle
is
not
normally
given
to
public
speaking
--
or
,
for
that
matter
,
to
private
speaking
.
``
What
do
you
and
Mickey
talk
about
at
home
''
?
?
A
reporter
asked
Maris
recently
.
``
To
tell
you
the
truth
''
,
Maris
said
,
``
Mickey
don't
talk
much
''
.
This
is
no
surprising
trait
for
a
ballplayer
.
What
is
surprising
and
pleasant
is
that
Mantle
and
Maris
,
under
constant
pressure
from
writers
and
photographers
,
are
trying
to
be
cooperative
.
Of
the
two
,
Mantle
is
by
nature
the
less
outgoing
,
Maris
the
more
outspoken
.
But
last
week
,
when
a
reporter
was
standing
near
Mantle's
locker
,
Mickey
walked
up
and
volunteered
an
anecdote
.
``
See
that
kid
''
?
?
He
said
,
pointing
to
a
dark-haired
11-year-old
boy
.
``
That's
(
Yogi
)
Berra's
.
I'll
never
forget
one
time
I
struck
out
three
times
,
dropped
a
fly
ball
,
and
we
lost
the
game
.
I
came
back
,
sitting
by
my
locker
,
feeling
real
low
,
and
the
kid
walks
over
to
me
,
looks
up
,
and
says
:
'
You
stunk
'
''
.
Maris
,
in
talking
to
reporters
,
tries
to
answer
all
questions
candidly
and
fully
,
but
on
rare
occasions
,
he
shuns
newsmen
.
``
When
I've
made
a
dumb
play
''
,
he
says
,
``
I
don't
want
to
talk
to
anyone
.
I'm
angry
''
.
By
his
own
confession
,
Maris
is
an
angry
young
man
.
Benched
at
Tulsa
in
1955
,
he
told
manager
Dutch
Meyer
:
``
I
can't
play
for
you
.
Send
me
where
I
can
play
''
.
(
Meyer
sent
him
to
Reading
,
Pa.
.
)
Benched
at
Indianapolis
in
1956
,
he
told
manager
Kerby
Farrell
:
``
I'm
not
learning
anything
on
the
bench
.
Play
me
''
.
(
Farrell
did
--
and
Maris
led
the
team
to
victory
in
the
Little
World
Series
.
)
``
That's
the
way
I
am
''
,
he
says
.
``
I
tell
people
what
I
think
.
If
you're
a
good
ballplayer
,
you've
got
to
get
mad
.
Give
me
a
team
of
nine
angry
men
and
I'll
give
you
a
team
of
nine
gentlemen
and
we'll
beat
you
nine
out
of
ten
times
''
.
Idols'
idols
:
One
good
indication
of
the
two
men's
personalities
is
the
way
they
reacted
to
meeting
their
own
heroes
.
Maris's
was
Ted
Williams
.
``
When
I
was
a
kid
''
,
Maris
told
a
sportswriter
last
week
,
``
I
used
to
follow
Williams
every
day
in
the
box
score
,
just
to
see
whether
he
got
a
hit
or
not
''
.
``
When
you
came
up
to
the
majors
,
did
you
seek
out
Williams
for
advice
''
?
?
``
Are
you
kidding
''
?
?
Said
Maris
.
``
You're
afraid
to
talk
to
a
guy
you
idolize
''
.
Mantle's
hero
was
Joe
DiMaggio
.
``
When
Mickey
went
to
the
Yankees
''
,
says
Mark
Freeman
,
an
ex-Yankee
pitcher
who
sells
mutual
funds
in
Denver
,
``
DiMaggio
still
was
playing
and
every
day
Mickey
would
go
by
his
locker
,
just
aching
for
some
word
of
encouragement
from
this
great
man
,
this
hero
of
his
.
But
DiMaggio
never
said
a
word
.
It
crushed
Mickey
.
He
told
me
he
vowed
right
then
that
if
he
ever
got
to
be
a
star
,
this
never
would
be
said
of
him
''
.
Mantle
has
kept
the
vow
.
Among
all
the
Yankees
,
he
is
the
veteran
most
friendly
to
rookies
.
Neither
Mantle
nor
Maris
is
totally
devoted
to
baseball
above
all
else
.
If
laying
ties
on
a
railroad
track
,
which
he
once
did
for
$1
an
hour
,
paid
more
than
playing
right
field
for
the
Yankees
,
Maris
would
lay
ties
on
a
railroad
track
.
If
working
in
a
zinc
mine
,
which
he
once
did
for
87-1/2
cents
an
hour
,
paid
more
than
playing
center
field
for
the
Yankees
,
Mantle
would
work
in
a
zinc
mine
.
But
since
railroading
and
mining
are
not
the
highest
paid
arts
,
Mantle
and
Maris
concentrate
on
baseball
.
They
try
to
play
baseball
the
best
they
can
.
Each
is
a
complete
ballplayer
.
Mantle
,
beyond
any
question
,
can
do
more
things
well
.
(
``
One
of
the
reasons
they
get
along
fine
''
,
says
a
sportswriter
who
is
friendly
with
the
two
men
,
``
is
that
both
realize
Mantle
is
head-and-shoulders
above
Maris
''
.
)
Hitting
,
Mantle
has
an
immediate
advantage
because
he
bats
both
left-handed
and
right-handed
,
Maris
only
left-handed
.
They
both
possess
near
classic
stances
,
dug
in
firmly
,
arms
high
,
set
for
fierce
swings
.
Mantle
is
considerably
better
hitting
for
average
(
,
fourth
in
the
league
,
to
for
Maris
so
far
this
year
)
.
Both
are
good
bunters
:
Maris
once
beat
out
eighteen
of
nineteen
in
the
minor
leagues
;
;
Mantle
is
a
master
at
dragging
a
bunt
toward
first
base
.
Both
have
brilliant
speed
:
Mantle
was
timed
from
home
plate
(
batting
left-handed
)
to
first
base
in
3.1
seconds
,
faster
than
any
other
major
leaguer
;
;
Maris
ran
the
100-yard
dash
in
ten
seconds
in
high
school
and
once
won
a
race
against
Luis
Aparicio
,
the
swift
,
base-stealing
shortstop
of
the
White
Sox
.
Both
are
good
,
daring
fielders
:
Mantle
covers
more
ground
;
;
Maris's
throwing
arm
is
stronger
.
Yet
with
all
their
skills
,
the
appeal
of
Mantle
and
Maris
in
1961
comes
down
to
one
basic
:
The
home
run
.
With
this
ultimate
weapon
,
the
two
Yankees
may
have
saved
baseball
from
its
dullest
season
.
(
American
League
expansion
created
,
inevitably
,
weaker
teams
.
Only
two
teams
in
each
league
(
the
Yankees
and
Detroit
,
the
Dodgers
and
Cincinnati
)
are
battling
for
first
place
.
Appropriately
,
the
emphasis
on
the
home
run
,
at
a
peak
this
year
,
came
into
being
at
baseball's
lowest
moment
.
In
1920
,
as
the
startling
news
that
the
1919
White
Sox
had
conspired
to
lose
the
World
Series
leaked
out
,
fans
grew
disillusioned
and
disinterested
in
baseball
.
Something
was
needed
to
revive
interest
;
;
the
something
was
the
home
run
.
Into
Washington
on
President-elect
John
F.
Kennedy's
Convair
,
the
Caroline
,
winged
Actor-Crooner
Frank
Sinatra
and
his
close
Hollywood
pal
,
Cinemactor
Peter
Lawford
,
Jack
Kennedy's
brother-in-law
.
Also
included
in
the
entourage
:
a
dog
in
a
black
sweater
,
Frankie
and
Peter
had
an
urgent
mission
:
to
stage
a
mammoth
Inauguration
Eve
entertainment
gala
in
the
capital's
National
Guard
Armory
.
Frankie
was
fairly
glutted
with
ideas
,
as
he
had
hinted
upon
his
arrival
:
``
It's
really
tremendous
when
you
think
Ella
Fitzgerald
is
coming
from
Australia
.
I
could
talk
to
you
for
three
hours
and
still
not
be
able
to
give
you
all
of
our
plans
''
!
!
As
the
plans
were
laid
,
some
several
thousand
fat
cats
were
to
be
ensconced
in
the
armory's
$100
seats
and
in
68
ringside
boxes
priced
at
$10,000
each
.
The
biggest
single
act
would
doubtless
be
staged
by
Frankie
himself
:
his
Inaugural
wardrobe
had
been
designed
by
Hollywood
Couturier
Don
Loper
,
who
regularly
makes
up
ladies'
ensembles
.
Soon
after
Loper
leaked
the
news
that
Frankie
had
ordered
``
two
of
everything
''
just
``
in
case
he
spills
anything
''
,
Frankie
got
so
mad
at
the
chic
designer
that
he
vowed
he
would
not
wear
a
stitch
of
Loper
clothing
.
A
year
after
he
was
catapulted
over
nine
officers
senior
to
him
and
made
commandant
of
the
Marine
Corps
,
General
David
M.
Shoup
delivered
a
peppery
annual
report
in
the
form
of
a
``
happy
,
warless
New
Year
''
greeting
to
his
Pentagon
staff
.
Said
Leatherneck
Shoup
:
``
A
year
ago
I
took
the
grips
of
the
plow
in
my
hands
.
After
pushing
an
accumulation
of
vines
and
weeds
from
the
moldboard
,
I
lifted
the
lines
from
the
dust
and
found
hitched
to
that
plow
the
finest
team
I
ever
held
a
rein
on
.
Little
geeing
and
hawing
have
been
necessary
''
.
But
Shoup
also
gave
the
Corps
a
tilling
in
spots
.
Speaking
of
``
pride
''
,
he
deplored
the
noncommissioned
officer
``
whose
uniform
looks
like
it
belonged
to
someone
who
retired
in
1940
;
;
the
officer
with
the
yellow
socks
or
the
bay
window
.
A
few
of
these
people
are
still
around
''
.
Old
and
new
briefly
crossed
paths
in
the
U.S.
Senate
,
then
went
their
respective
ways
.
At
a
reception
for
new
members
of
Congress
,
Oregon
Democrat
Maurine
Neuberger
,
taking
the
Senate
seat
held
by
her
husband
Richard
until
his
death
last
March
,
got
a
brotherly
buss
from
Democratic
Elder
Statesman
Adlai
Stevenson
,
U.S.
Ambassador-designate
to
the
U.N.
.
Meanwhile
,
after
24
years
in
the
Senate
,
Rhode
Island's
durable
Democrat
Theodore
Francis
Greene
--
having
walked
,
swum
and
cerebrated
himself
to
the
hearty
age
of
93
--
left
that
august
body
(
voluntarily
,
because
he
could
surely
have
been
re-elected
had
he
chosen
to
run
again
last
November

last

it
developed
that
he
will

The

that
--
despite
the
help
of
private
tutors
in
Hollywood
and
Philadelphia
--
Fabian
is
a
10-o'clock
scholar
in
English

mathematics

Lacking

in

subjects
,
Fabian
will
not

next

``

Then
Charlie
spooned
out
some
quick
impressions
of

Nikita

had
glimpsed
:
``
I
was
captivated

G.
David
Thompson
is
one
of
those
names
known
to
the
stewards
of
transatlantic
jetliners
and
to
doormen
in
Europe's
best
hotels
,
but
he
is
somewhat
of
an
enigma
to
most
people
in
his
own
home
town
of
Pittsburgh
.
There
the
name
vaguely
connotes
new-rich
wealth
,
a
reputation
for
eccentricity
,
and
an
ardor
for
collecting
art
.
Last
week
,
in
the
German
city
of
Dusseldorf
,
G.
David
Thompson
was
making
headlines
that
could
well
give
Pittsburgh
pause
.
On
display
were
343
first-class
paintings
and
sculptures
from
his
fabled
collection
--
and
every
single
one
of
them
was
up
for
sale
.
Like
Philadelphia's
late
Dr.
Albert
C.
Barnes
who
kept
his
own
great
collection
closed
to
the
general
public
(
Time
,
Jan.
2
)
,
Thompson
,
at
61
,
is
something
of
a
legend
in
his
own
lifetime
.
He
made
his
fortune
during
World
War
2
,
when
he
took
over
a
number
of
dying
steel
plants
and
kept
them
alive
until
the
boom
.
Even
before
he
hit
big
money
,
he
had
begun
buying
modern
paintings
.
He
gave
the
impression
of
never
having
read
a
word
about
art
,
but
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
had
an
eye
for
the
best
.
He
was
able
to
smell
a
bargain
--
and
a
masterpiece
--
a
continent
away
,
and
the
Museum
of
Modern
Art's
Alfred
Barr
said
of
him
:
``
I
have
never
mentioned
a
new
artist
that
Thompson
didn't
know
about
''
.
He
might
barge
into
a
gallery
,
start
haggling
over
prices
without
so
much
as
a
word
of
greeting
.
He
could
be
lavishly
generous
with
friends
,
cab
drivers
and
bellboys
,
but
with
dealers
he
was
tough
.
He
bought
up
Cezannes
,
Braques
,
Matisses
,
Legers
,
a
splendid
Picasso
series
,
more
than
70
Giacometti
sculptures
.
He
gathered
one
of
the
biggest
collections
of
Paul
Klees
in
the
world
.
All
these
he
hung
in
his
burglarproof
home
called
Stone's
Throw
,
outside
Pittsburgh
,
and
only
people
he
liked
and
trusted
ever
got
to
see
them
.
Two
years
ago
Thompson
offered
his
collection
to
the
city
.
But
he
insisted
that
it
be
housed
in
a
special
museum
.
Pittsburgh
turned
him
down
,
just
as
Pittsburgh
society
had
been
snubbing
him
for
years
.
He
went
then
to
a
40-year-old
Basel
art
dealer
named
Ernst
Beyeler
,
with
whom
he
had
long
been
trading
pictures
.
Last
year
Beyeler
arranged
to
sell
$1,500,000
worth
of
Klees
to
the
state
of
North
Rhine-Westphalia
,
which
will
house
them
in
a
museum
that
is
yet
to
be
built
.
Last
week
most
of
the
other
prizes
,
once
offered
to
Pittsburgh
,
went
on
the
block
.
At
the
opening
of
the
Dusseldorf
show
,
Thompson
himself
scarcely
glanced
at
the
treasures
that
he
was
seeing
together
for
the
last
time
.
